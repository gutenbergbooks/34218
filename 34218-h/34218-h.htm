<h2>HILDEGARDE'S HOME.</h2>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>CHAPTER I.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE HOME ITSELF.</div>


<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">It</span> was a pleasant place. The house was
a large, low, old-fashioned one, with the
modern addition of a deep, wide verandah
running across its front. Before it was a
circular sweep of lawn, fringed with trees;
beside it stood a few noble elms, which bent
lovingly above the gambrel roof. There were
some flower-beds, rather neglected-looking,
under the south windows, and there was a
kitchen-garden behind the house. This was
all that Hildegarde Grahame had seen so far
of her new home, for she had only just<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
arrived. She stood now on the verandah,
looking about her with keen, inquiring eyes,
a tall, graceful girl, very erect, with a certain
proud carriage of the head. Her dress of black
and white shepherd's plaid was very simple,
but it fitted to perfection, and there was a
decided "air" to her little black felt hat.</div>

<p>Hildegarde's father had died about six
months before the time our story opens. He
had been very wealthy, but many of his
investments had shrunk in value, and the
failure of a bank whose cashier had proved
dishonest entailed heavy losses upon him;
so that, after his death, it was found that
the sum remaining for his widow and only
child, after all debts were paid, was no very
large one. They would have enough to live
on, and to live comfortably; but the "big
luxuries," as Hildegarde called them, the
horses and carriages, the great New York
house with its splendid furniture and troops<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
of servants, must go; and go they did, without
loss of time. Perhaps neither Hildegarde
nor her mother regretted these things much.
Mrs. Grahame had been for years an indefatigable
worker, giving most of her time to
charities; she knew that she should never
rest so long as she lived in New York.
Hildegarde had been much in the country
during the past two years, had learned to
love it greatly, and found city life too "cabined,
cribbed, confined," to suit her present
taste. The dear father had always preferred
to live in town; but now that he was gone,
they were both glad to go away from the
great, bustling, noisy, splendid place. So,
when Mrs. Grahame's lawyer told her that
an aged relative, who had lately died, had
left his country house as a legacy to her, both
she and Hildegarde said at once, "Let us go
and live there!"</p>

<p>Accordingly, here they were! or to speak<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
more accurately, here Hildegarde was, for
she and auntie (auntie was the black cook;
she had been Mrs. Grahame's nurse, and had
been cook ever since Hildegarde was a baby)
had come by an early train, and were to have
everything as comfortable as might be by the
time Mrs. Grahame and the little housemaid,
who had stayed to help her pack the last
trifles, should arrive in the afternoon.</p>

<p>It was so pleasant on the wide verandah,
with the great elms nodding over it, that
Hildegarde lingered, until a mellow "Miss
Hildy, chile! you comin'?" summoned her
in-doors. Auntie had already put on her
white jacket and apron, without which she
never considered herself dressed, and her
muslin turban looked like a snow-drift on an
ebony statue. She had opened the door of a
large room, and was peering into it, feather
duster in hand.</p>

<p>"'Spose this is the parlour!" she said, with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
a glance of keen observation. "Comicalest
parlour ever I see!"</p>

<p>Hildegarde stepped lightly across the threshold.
It <i>was</i> a singular room, but, she thought,
a very pleasant one. The carpet on the
floor was thick and soft, of some eastern
fabric, but so faded that the colours were
hardly distinguishable. Against the walls
stood many chairs, delicate, spider-legged
affairs, with cushions of faded tapestry.
The curtains might once have been crimson,
when they had any colour. A table in
the exact centre of the room was covered
with a worked cloth of curious and antique
pattern, and on it were some venerable annuals,
and "Finden's Tableaux," bound in green
morocco. In a dim corner stood the great-grandmother
of all pianos. It was hardly
larger than a spinnet, and was made of some
light-coloured, highly polished wood, cunningly
inlaid with ivory and mother-of-pearl. Over<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
the yellow keys was a painting, representing
Apollo (attired, to all appearance, like the
"old man on a hill," in his grandmother's
gown), capering to the sound of his lyre, and
followed by nine young ladies in pink and
green frocks. The last young lady carried a
parasol, showing that the Muses thought as
much of their complexions as other people
do. At sight of this venerable instrument
Hildegarde uttered a cry of delight, and, running
across the room, touched a few chords
softly. The sound was faint and tinkling,
but not unmusical. Auntie sniffed audibly.</p>

<p>"Reckon my kittle makes a better music
'an that!" she said; and then, relenting, she
added, "might ha' been pooty once, I dassay.
That's a pooty picture, anyhow, over the
mankel-piece."</p>

<p>Hildegarde looked up, and saw a coloured
print of a lady in the costume of the First
Empire, with golden ringlets, large blue eyes,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
particularly round rosy cheeks, and the most
amiable simper in the world. Beneath was
the inscription, "Madame R&eacute;camier, Napoleon's
first love."</p>

<p>"Oh!" cried Hildegarde, half-laughing,
half-indignant, "how ridiculous! She wasn't,
you know! and she never looked like that,
any more than I do. But see, auntie! see
this great picture of General Washington, in
his fine scarlet coat. I am sure you must
admire that! Why!&mdash;it cannot be&mdash;yes, it
is! it is done in worsted-work. Fine cross-stitch,
every atom of it. Oh! it makes my
eyes ache to think of it."</p>

<p>Auntie nodded approvingly. "That's what
I call work!" she said. "That's what young
ladies used to do when I was a gal. Don't
see no sech work nowadays, only just a passel
o' flowers and crooked lines, and calls it
embr'idery."</p>

<p>"Oh! you ungrateful old auntie," cried<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
Hildegarde, "when I marked your towels so
beautifully last week. Here! since you are
so fond of cross-stitch, take this dreadful yellow
sofa-pillow, with pink roses worked on it.
It will just fit your own beloved rocking-chair,
with the creak in it, and you may have
it for your very own."</p>

<p>The pillow flew across the room, and auntie,
catching it, disappeared with a chuckle, while
Hildegarde resumed her examination of the
quaint old parlour. The "cross-stitch" was
everywhere: on the deep, comfortable old
sofa, where one leaned against a stag-hunt,
and had a huntsman blowing his horn on
either arm; on the chairs, where one might
sit on baskets of flowers, dishes of fruit, or
cherubs' heads, as one's fancy dictated; on
the long fender-stool, where an appalling line
of dragons, faintly red, on a ground that had
been blue, gaped open-mouthed, as if waiting
to catch an unwary foot.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh! their <i>poor</i> eyes!" cried Hildegarde.
"How <i>could</i> their mothers let them?" She
passed her hand compassionately over the
fine lines of the stag-hunt. "Were they
girls, do you suppose?" she went on, talking
to herself, as she was fond of doing. "Girls
like me, or slender old spinsters, like the
chairs and the piano? Mamma must have
known some of them when she was a child;
she said she had once made a visit here. I
must ask her all about them. Uncle Aytoun!
what a pity he isn't alive, to show us about
his house! But if he were alive, we should
not be here at all. So nice of you to leave
the house to mamma, dear sir, just as if you
had been her real uncle, instead of her father's
cousin. You must have been a very nice old
gentleman. I like old gentlemen." The girl
paused, and presently gave an inquiring sniff.
"What is it?" she said meditatively. "Not
exactly mould, for it is dry; not must, for it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
is sweet. The smell of this particular room,
for it, suits it exactly. It is"&mdash;she sniffed
again&mdash;"it is as if some Aytoun ladies before
the flood had made <i>pot-pourri</i>, and it had somehow
kept dry. Let us examine this matter!"
She tiptoed about the room, and, going round
the corner of the great chimney, found a cupboard
snugly tucked in beside it. She opened
it, with a delightful thrill of curiosity. Hildegarde
did love cupboards! Of course, there
might be nothing at all&mdash;but there was something!
On the very first shelf stood a row of
china pots, carefully covered, and from these
pots came the faint, peculiar perfume which
seemed so to form part of the faded charm of
the room. The pots were of delicate white
porcelain, one with gold sprigs on it, one with
blue flowers, and one with pink. "Belonging
to three Aytoun sisters!" said Hildegarde.
"Of course! dear things! If they had only
written their names on the jars!" She lifted<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
the gold-sprigged jar with reverent hands.
Lo, and behold! On the cover was pasted
a neat label, which said, "Hester's recipe,
June, 18&mdash;." She examined the other two
jars eagerly. They bore similar legends, with
the names "Agatha" and "Barbara." On
all the writing was in minute but strongly
marked characters; the three hands were
different, yet there was a marked resemblance.
Hildegarde stood almost abashed, as if she
had found herself in presence of the three
ladies themselves. "The question is"&mdash;she
murmured apologetically&mdash;and then she
stooped and sniffed carefully, critically, at
the three jars in turn. "There is no doubt
about it!" she said at last. "Hester's recipe
is the best, for it has outlived the others, and
given its character to the whole room. Poor
Miss Agatha and Miss Barbara! How disappointed
they would be!" As she closed
the cupboard softly and turned away, it almost<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
seemed&mdash;almost, but not quite, for
though Hildegarde had a lively imagination,
she was not at all superstitious&mdash;as though
she heard a faint sigh, and saw the shadowy
forms of the three Aytoun sisters turning
away sadly from the cupboard where their
treasure was kept. The shadow was her own,
the sigh was that of an evening breeze as it
stole in between the faded curtains; but
Hildegarde had a very pretty little romance
made up by the time she reached the other
side of the long room, and when she softly
closed the door, it was not without a whispered
"good evening!" to the three ladies
whom she left in possession.</p>

<p>Shaking off the dream, she ran quickly up
the winding stairs, and turned into the pleasant,
sunny room which she had selected as
the best for her mother's bedchamber. It
was more modern-looking than the rest of the
house, in spite of its quaint Chinese-patterned<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
chintz hangings and furniture; this was
partly owing to a large bow-window which
almost filled one side, and through which the
evening light streamed in cheerfully. Hildegarde
had already unpacked a trunk of "alicumtweezles"
(a word not generally known,
and meaning small but cherished possessions),
and the room was a pleasant litter of down
pillows, cologne-bottles, work-implements, photograph
cases and odd books. Now she inspected
the chairs with a keen and critical
eye, pounced upon one, sat down in it, shook
her head and tried another. Finding this to
her mind, she drew it into the bow-window,
half-filled it with a choice assortment of
small pillows, and placed a little table beside
it, on which she set a fan, a bottle of cologne,
a particularly inviting little volume of
Wordsworth (Hildegarde had not grown up
to Wordsworth yet, but her mother had), a
silver bonbonni&egrave;re full of Marquis chocolate-drops,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
and a delicate white knitting-basket
which was having a little sunset of its own
with rose-coloured "Saxony." "There!" said
Hildegarde, surveying this composition with
unfeigned satisfaction. "If that isn't attractive,
I don't know what is. She won't eat
the chocolates, of course, bless her! but they
give it an air, and I can eat them for her.
And now I must put away towels and pillow-cases,
which is not so interesting."</p>

<p>At this moment, however, the sound of
wheels was heard on the gravel, and tossing
the linen on the bed, Hildegarde ran down to
welcome her mother.</p>

<p>Mrs. Grahame was very tired, and was glad
to come directly up to the pleasant room, and
sink down in the comfortable chair which
was holding out its stout chintz arms to
receive her.</p>

<p>"What a perfect chair!" she said, taking
off her bonnet and looking about her.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
"What a very pleasant room! I know you
have given me the best one, you dear child!"</p>

<p>"I hope so!" said Hildegarde. "I meant
to, certainly&mdash; Oh, no!" she started forward
and took the bonnet which Mrs. Grahame
was about to lay on the table; "this table is
to take things from, dear. I must give you
another to put things on."</p>

<p>"I see!" said her mother, surveying the
decorated table with amusement. "This is a
still-life piece, and a very pretty one. But
how can I possibly take anything off it? I
should spoil the harmony. The straw-covered
cologne-bottle makes just the proper background
for the chocolates, and though I
should like to wet my handkerchief with it,
I do not dare to disturb&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Take care!" cried Hildegarde, snatching
up the bottle and deluging the handkerchief
with its contents. "You might hurt my feelings,
Mrs. Grahame, and that would not be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
pleasant for either of us. And you know it
is pretty, <i>quand m&ecirc;me!</i>"</p>

<p>"It is, my darling, very pretty!" said her
mother, "and you are my dear, thoughtful
child, as usual. The Wordsworth touch I
specially appreciate. He is so restful, with
his smooth, brown covers. Your white
and gold Shelley, there, would have been
altogether too exciting for my tired nerves."</p>

<p>"Oh! I have nothing to say against Mr.
W.'s <i>covers!</i>" said Hildegarde with cheerful
malice. "They are charming covers. And
now tell me what kind of journey you had,
and how you got through the last agonies,
and all about it."</p>

<p>"Why, we got through very well indeed!"
said Mrs. Grahame. "Janet was helpful and
quick as usual, and Hicks nailed up all the
boxes, and took charge of everything that
was to be stored or sold. Sad work! but I
am glad it is done." She sighed, and Hildegarde<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
sat down on the floor beside her, and
leaned her cheek against the beloved mother-hand.</p>

<p>"Dear!" she said, and that was all, for
each knew the other's thoughts. It was no
light matter, the breaking up of a home
where nearly all the young girl's life, and the
happiest years of her mother's, had been
passed. Every corner in the New York
house was filled with memories of the dear
and noble man whom they so truly mourned,
and it had seemed to them both, though they
had not spoken of it, as if in saying good-by
to the home which he had loved, they were
taking another and a more final farewell of
him.</p>

<p>So they sat in silence for a while, the tender
pressure of the hand saying more than
words could have done; but when Mrs. Grahame
spoke at last, it was in her usual cheerful
tone.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>"So at last everything was ready, and I
locked the door, and gave the keys to the
faithful Hicks" (Hicks had been the Grahames'
butler for several years), "and then Hicks
came down to the station with me, and did
everything that was possible to secure a comfortable
journey for me&mdash;and Janet."</p>

<p>"Poor Hicks!" said Hildegarde, smiling.
"It must have been very hard for him to say
good-by to you&mdash;and Janet."</p>

<p>"I think it was!" said Mrs. Grahame.
"He asked me, very wistfully, if we should
not need some one to take care of the garden,
and said he was very fond of out-door work;
but I had to tell him that we should only
need a 'chore-man,' to do odds and ends of
work, and should not keep a gardener. At
this he put on a face like three days of rain,
as your Grimm story says, and the train
started, and that was all.</p>

<p>"And now tell me, Sweetheart," she added,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
"what have been your happenings. First of
all, how do you like the house?"</p>

<p>"Oh, it's a jewel of a house!" replied Hildegarde
with enthusiasm. "You told me it
was pleasant, but I had no idea of anything
like this. The verandah itself is worth the
whole of most houses. Then the parlour!
such a wonderful parlour! I am sure you
will agree with me that it would be sacrilege
to put any of our modern belongings in it. I
did give auntie one hideous sofa-pillow, but
otherwise I have touched nothing. It is a
perfect museum of cross-stitch embroidery,
sacred to the memory of Miss Barbara, Miss
Agatha, and Miss Hester."</p>

<p>Mrs. Grahame smiled. "How did you discover
their names?" she asked. "I was
saving them for an after-supper 'tell' for
you, and now you have stolen my thunder,
you naughty child."</p>

<p>"Not a single growl of it!" cried Hildegarde<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
eagerly. "I am fairly prancing with
impatience to hear about them. All I know
is their names, which I found written on three
bow-pots in the cupboard. I went mousing
about, like little Silver-hair, and instead of
three porridge-pots, found these. Miss Hester's
was the only pot that had any 'sniff'
left to speak of; from which I inferred that
she was the sprightliest of the three sisters,
and perhaps the youngest and prettiest. Now
<i>don't</i> tell me that she was the eldest, and lackadaisical,
and cross-eyed!"</p>

<p>"I will not!" said Mrs. Grahame, laughing.
"I will not tell you anything till I have
had my tea. I had luncheon at one o'clock,
and it is now&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Seven!" cried Hildegarde, springing up,
and beating her breast. "You are starved,
my poor darling, and I am a Jew, Turk,
infidel, and heretic; I always was!"</p>

<p>She ran out to call Janet; when lo, there<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
was Janet just coming up to tell them that
tea was ready. She was the prettiest possible
Janet, as Scotch as her name, with rosy
cheeks and wide, innocent blue eyes, and
"lint-white locks," as a Scotch lassie should
have. "No wonder," thought Hildegarde,
"that Hicks looked like '<i>drei Tage Regenwetter</i>'
at parting from her."</p>

<p>"Tea is ready, you say, Janet?" cried
Hildegarde. "That is good, for we are
'gay and ready,' as you say. Come, my
mother! let us go and see what auntie has
for us."</p>

<p>Mother and daughter went down arm-in-arm,
like two school-girls. They had to pick
their way carefully, for the lamps had not
been lighted, and there was not daylight
enough to shed more than a faint glimmer
on the winding stairs; but when they reached
the dining-room a very blaze of light greeted
them. There were no less than six candles<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
on the table, in six silver candlesticks shaped
like Corinthian columns. (Auntie had hidden
these candlesticks in her own trunk, with a
special eye to this effect.) On the table also
was everything good, and hot blueberry cake
beside; and behind it stood auntie herself,
very erect and looking so solemn that Mrs.
Grahame and Hildegarde stopped in the doorway,
and stood still for a moment. The black
woman raised her head with a gesture of tenderness,
not without majesty.</p>

<p>"De Lord bless de house to ye!" she said
solemnly. "De Lord send ye good victuals,
and plenty of 'em! De Lord grant ye never
want for nothin', forever an' ever, give glory,
amen!"</p>

<p>And with an answering "amen!" on their
lips, Hildegarde and her mother sat down to
their first meal in their new home.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>A DISH OF GOSSIP.</div>


<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">The</span> evening was too lovely to spend in the
house, so Mrs. Grahame and Hildegarde went
from the tea-table out on the verandah, where
some low, comfortable straw chairs were
already placed. It was June, and the air
was full of the scent of roses, though there
were none in sight. There was no moon, but
it was hardly missed, so brilliant were the
stars, flashing their golden light down through
the elm-branches.</div>

<p>They sat for some time, enjoying the quiet
beauty of the night. Then&mdash;"I think we
shall be happy here, dear!" said Hildegarde
softly. "It feels like home already."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p>"I am glad to hear you say that!" replied
her mother. "Surely the place itself is
charming. I hope, too, that you may find
some pleasant companions, of your own age.
Yes, I can see you shake your head, even in
the dark; and of course we shall be together
constantly, my darling; but I still hope you
will find some girl friend, since dear Rose
(Rose was Hildegarde's bosom friend) cannot
be with us this summer. Now tell me, did
you find Mrs. Lankton here when you arrived?
We don't seem to have come down to
details yet."</p>

<p>Hildegarde began to laugh.</p>

<p>"I should think we did find her!" she said.
"Your coming put it all out of my head, you
see. Well, when auntie and I drove up, there
was this funny little old dame standing in
the doorway, looking so like Mrs. Gummidge
that I wanted to ask her on the spot if Mr.
Peggotty was at home. She began shaking<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
her head and sighing, before we could get
out of the wagon. 'Ah, dear me!' she said.
'Dear me! and this is the young lady, I
suppose. Ah! yes, indeed! And the housekeeper,
I suppose. Well, well! I'm proper
glad to see you. Ah, dear, dear!' All this
was said in a tone of the deepest dejection,
and she kept on shaking her head and sighing.
Auntie spoke up pretty smartly, 'I'm
de cook!' she said. 'If you'll take dis basket,
ma'am, we'll do de lamintations ourselves!'
Mrs. Lankton didn't hear the last part of the
remark, but she took the basket, and auntie
and I jumped out. 'I suppose you are Mrs.
Lankton, the care-taker,' I said, as cheerfully
as I could. 'Ah, yes, dear!' she said, mournfully.
'I'm Mrs. Lankton, the widow Lankton,
housekeeper to Mr. Aytoun as was, and
care-taker since his dee-cease. I've took care,
Miss Grahame, my dear. There ain't no one
could keep things more car'ful nor I have. If<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
I've had trouble, it hasn't made me no less
car'ful. Ah, dear me! it's a sorrowful world.
Perhaps you'd like to come in.' This seemed
to be a new idea to her, though we had been
standing with our hands full of bundles, only
waiting for her to move. She led the way
into the hall. 'This is the hall!' she said
sadly; and then she stood shaking her head
like a melancholy mandarin. 'I s'pose 'tis!'
said auntie, who was quite furious by this
time, and saw no fun in it at all. 'And I
s'pose dis is a door, and I'll go t'rough it.'
And off she flounced through the door at the
back of the hall, where she found the kitchen
for herself, as we could tell by the rattling of
pans which followed. 'She's got a temper,
ain't she?' said Mrs. Lankton sadly. 'Most
coloured people has. There! I had one myself,
before 'twas took out of me by trouble.
Not that I've got any coloured blood in me,
for my father was Nova Scoshy and my<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
mother State of New York. Shall I take you
through the house, dear?'"</p>

<p>"Poor Mrs. Lankton!" said Mrs. Grahame,
laughing. "She is the very spirit of melancholy.
I believe she has really had a good
deal of trouble. Well, dear?"</p>

<p>"Well," resumed Hildegarde, "I really
could not have her spoil all the fun of going
over the house for me; though of course she
was great fun herself in a way. So I thanked
her, and said I would not give her the trouble,
and said I supposed she lived near, and we
should often call on her when we wanted extra
help. 'So do, dear!' she said, 'so do! I live
right handy by, in a brown cottage with a green
door, the only brown cottage, <i>and</i> the only
green door, so you can't mistake me. You've
got beautiful neighbours, too,' she added, still
in the depths of melancholy. 'Beautiful
neighbours! Mis' Loftus lives in the stone
house over yonder. Ah, dear me! She and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
her darter, they don't never set foot to the
ground, one year's eend to the other.' 'Dear
me!' I said. 'Are they both such invalids?'
'No, dear!' said she, sighing as if she wished
they were. 'Carriage folks; great carriage
folks. Then there's Colonel Ferrers lives in
the brick house across the way. Beautiful
man, but set in his ways. Never speaks to a
soul, one year's eend to the other, in the way
o' talk, that is. Ah! dear me, yes!'"</p>

<p>"It sounds like Alice in Wonderland!"
exclaimed Mrs. Grahame. "In that direction
lives a Hatter, and in that direction lives a
March Hare. Visit either you like! they're
both mad."</p>

<p>"Oh, Mammina, it is exactly like it!" cried
Hildegarde, clapping her hands. "You clever
Mammina! I wonder if Colonel Ferrers has
long ears, and if his roof is thatched with
fur."</p>

<p>"Hush!" said her mother, laughing. "This<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
will not do. I know Colonel Ferrers, and he
is an excellent man, though a trifle singular.
Well, dear, how did you part with your melancholy
dame?"</p>

<p>"She went away then," said Hildegarde.
"Oh, no, she didn't. I forgot! she did insist
upon showing me the room where Uncle Aytoun
died; and&mdash;oh! mamma, it is almost too bad
to tell, and yet it was very funny. She said
he died like a perfect gentleman, and made a
beautiful remains. Then, at last, she said
good-night and charged me to send for her if
any of us should be ill in the night. 'Comin'
strange in,' she said, 'it's likely to disagree
with some of you, and in spasms or anything
suddint, I'm dretful knowin'.' So she went
off at last, and it took me a quarter of an
hour to get auntie into a good temper again."</p>

<p>They laughed heartily at Mrs. Lankton's
idea of "the parting word of cheer"; and
then Hildegarde reminded her mother of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
"tell" she had promised her. "I want to
know <i>all</i> about the three ladies," she said.
"They seem more real than Dame Lankton,
somehow, for they belong here, and she never
could have. So 'come tell me all, my
mother, all, all that ever you know!'"</p>

<p>"It is not so very much, after all," replied
Mrs. Grahame, after a moment's thought. "I
came here once with my father, when I was
about ten years old, and stayed two or three
days. Miss Hester was already dead; she
was the youngest, the beauty of the family,
and she was still young when she died. Miss
Barbara was the eldest, a tall, slender woman,
with a high nose; very kind, but a little stiff
and formal. She was the head of the family,
and very religious. It was Saturday, I remember,
when we came, and she gave me
some lovely Chinese ivory toys to play with,
which filled the whole horizon for me. But
the next morning she took them away, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
gave me Baxter's 'Saint's Rest,' which she
said I must read all the morning, as I had a
cold and could not go to church."</p>

<p>"Poor Mammina!" said Hildegarde.</p>

<p>"Not so poor," said her mother, smiling.
"Miss Agatha came to the rescue, and took
me up to her room, and let me look in the
drawers of a wonderful old cabinet, full of
what your dear father used to call 'picknickles
and bucknickles.'"</p>

<p>"Oh! I know; I found the cabinet yesterday!"
cried Hildegarde in delight. "I had
not time to look into it, but it was all drawers;
a dark, foreign-looking thing, inlaid with
ivory!"</p>

<p>"Yes, that is it," said her mother. "I
wonder if the funny things are still in it?
Miss Agatha was an invalid, and her room
looked as if she lived in it a good deal. She
told me Bible stories in her soft, feeble voice,
and showed me a very wonderful set of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
coloured prints illustrating the Old Testament.
I remember distinctly that Joseph's coat was
striped, red, green, yellow, and blue, like a
mattress ticking gone mad, and that the she-bear
who came to devour the naughty children
was bright pink."</p>

<p>"Oh! delightful!" cried Hildegarde, laughing.
"I must try to find those prints."</p>

<p>"She told me, too, about her sister Hester,"
Mrs. Grahame went on; "how beautiful
she was, and how bright and gay and light-hearted.
'She was the sunshine, my dear,
and we are the shadow, Barbara and I,' she
said. I remember the very words. And then
she showed me a picture, a miniature on
ivory, of a lovely girl of sixteen, holding a
small harp in her arms. She had large grey
eyes, I remember, and long fair curls. Dear
me! how it all comes back to me, after the
long, long years. I can almost see that miniature
now. Why&mdash;why, Hilda, it had a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
little look of you; or, rather, you look like
it."</p>

<p>The girl flushed rosy red. "I am glad,"
she said softly. "And she died young, you
say? Miss Hester, I mean."</p>

<p>"At twenty-two or three," assented her
mother. "It was consumption, I believe.
Cousin Wealthy Bond once told me that
Hester had some sad love affair, but I know
nothing more about it. I do know, however,
that Uncle Aytoun (he was the only brother,
you know, and spent much of his life at sea),
I do know that he was desperately in love
with dear Cousin Wealthy herself."</p>

<p>"Oh!" cried Hildegarde. "Poor old
gentleman! She couldn't, of course; but I
am sorry for him."</p>

<p>"He was not old then," said Mrs. Grahame,
smiling. "He knew of Cousin Wealthy's
own trouble, but he was very much in love,
and hoped he could make her forget it. One<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
day&mdash;Cousin Wealthy told me this years and
years afterward, <i>&agrave; pr&ocirc;pos</i> of my own engagement&mdash;one
day Captain Aytoun came to see
her, and as it was a beautiful summer day, she
took him out into the garden to see some rare
lilies that were just in blossom. He looked at
the lilies, but said little; he was a very silent
man. Presently he pulled out his card-case,
and took from it a visiting-card, on which
was engraved his name, 'Robert F. Aytoun.'
He wrote something on the card, and handed
it to Cousin Wealthy; and she read, 'Robert
F. Aytoun's heart is yours.'"</p>

<p>"Mammina!" cried Hildegarde. "Can it
be true? It is <i>too</i> funny! But what could
she say? Dear Cousin Wealthy!"</p>

<p>"I remember her very words," said Mrs.
Grahame. "'Captain Aytoun, it is not my
intention ever to marry; but I esteem your
friendship highly, and I thank you for the
honour you offer me. Permit me to call your<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
attention to this new variety of ranunculus.'
But the poor captain said,&mdash;Cousin Wealthy
could hardly bring herself to repeat this,
for she thought it very shocking,&mdash;'Confound
the ranunculus!' and strode out of the
garden and away. And Cousin Wealthy took
the card into the house, and folded it up, and
wound pearl-coloured silk on it. It may be
in her work-basket now, for she never destroys
anything."</p>

<p>"Oh! that was a most delightful 'tell'!"
sighed Hildegarde. "And now go on about
Miss Agatha."</p>

<p>"I fear that is all, dear," said her mother.
"I remember singing some hymns, which
pleased the kind cousin. Then Miss Barbara
came home from church; and I rather think
her conscience had been pricking her about
the 'Saint's Rest,' for she took me down and
gave me some delicious jelly of rose leaves,
which she said was good for a cold. We had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
waffles for tea, I remember, and we put cinnamon
and sugar on them; I had never tasted
the combination before, so I remember it. It
was in a glass dish shaped like a pineapple.
And after tea Miss Barbara tinkled 'Jerusalem,
the Golden' on the piano, and we all
sang, and I went to bed at nine o'clock.
And that reminds me," said Mrs. Grahame,
"that it must now be ten o'clock or after, and
'time for all good little constitutional queens
to be in bed.'"</p>

<p>"Oh! must we go to bed?" sighed Hildegarde.
"It is so very particularly lovely
here. Well, I suppose we should have to go
some time. Good-night, dear stars! good-night,
all beautiful things that I know are
there, though I cannot see you!"</p>

<p>Hildegarde helped her mother to lock up
the house, and then, after a parting word and
caress, she took her candle and went to the
room she had chosen for her own. It opened<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
out of her mother's dressing-room, so that by
setting the doors ajar, they could talk to each
other when so minded; and it had a dressing-room
of its own on the other side, from
which a flight of narrow, corkscrew stairs
descended to the ground floor. These stairs
had attracted Hildegarde particularly. It
seemed very pleasant and important to have
a staircase of one's own, which no one else
could use. It is true that it was very dark,
very crooked and steep, but that was no
matter. The bedroom itself was large and
airy; a little bare, perhaps, but Hildegarde
did not mind that. The white paint was
very fresh and clean, and set off the few
pieces of dark old mahogany furniture well,&mdash;a
fine bureau, with the goddess Aurora careering
in brass across the front of the top
drawer; a comfortable sofa, with cushions
of the prettiest pale green chintz, with rosebuds
scattered over it; a round table; a few<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
spider-legged chairs; and a nondescript piece
of furniture, half dressing-table, half chest of
drawers, which was almost as mysteriously
promising as the inlaid cabinet in Miss
Agatha's room. The bed was large and
solemn-looking, with carved posts topped by
pineapples. The floor was bare, save for a
square of ancient Turkey carpet in the middle.
Hildegarde held the candle above her head, and
surveyed her new quarters with satisfaction.</p>

<p>"Nice room!" she said, nodding her head.
"The sort of room I have been thinking
of ever since I outgrew flounces, and bows
on the chairs. Dear papa! When I was at
the height of the flounce fever, he begged
me to have a frock and trousers made
for the grand piano, as he was sure it must
wound my sensibilities to see it so bare.
Dear papa! He would like this room, too.
It is a little strange-garrety to-night, but
wait till I get the Penates out to-morrow!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>She nodded again, and then, putting on
her wrapper, proceeded to brush out her long,
fair hair. It was beautiful hair; and as it
fell in shining waves from the brush, Hildegarde
began to think again of the dead
Hester, who had had fair hair, too, and whom
her mother had thought she resembled a
little. She hoped that this might have been
Hester's room. Indeed, she had chosen it
partly with this idea, though chiefly because
she wished to be near her mother. It certainly
was not Miss Agatha's room, for that
was on the other side of the passage. Her
mother's room had been Miss Barbara's, she
was quite sure, for "B" was embroidered on
the faded cover of the dressing-table. Another
large room was too rigid in its aspect
to have been anything but a spare room or a
death chamber, and Mr. Aytoun's own room,
where he had died like a gentleman and
become a "beautiful remains," was on the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
ground floor. Therefore, it was very plain,
this must have been Hester's room. Here
she had lived her life, a girl like herself,
thought Hildegarde, and had been gay and
light-hearted, the sunshine of the house; and
then she had suffered, and faded away
and died. It was with a solemn feeling that
the young girl climbed up into the great bed,
and laid her head where that other fair head
had lain. Who could tell what was coming
to her, too, in this room? And could she
make sunshine for her mother, who had lost
the great bright light which had warmed and
cheered her during so many years? Then
her thoughts turned to that other light which
had never failed this dear mother; and so,
with a murmured "My times be in thy
hand!" Hildegarde fell asleep.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER III.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>MORNING HOURS.</div>

<div class='poem'>
"The year's at the spring,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And day's at the morn:</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Morning's at seven;</span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">God's in his heaven&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">All's right with the world!"</span><br />
</div>


<div class='unindent'><br /><span class="smcap">These</span> seemed the most natural words to
sing, as Hildegarde looked out of her window
next morning; and sing them she did, with
all her heart, as she threw open the shutters
and let the glad June sunlight stream into
the room. All sad thoughts were gone with
the night, and now there seemed nothing but
joy in the world.</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>"Where art thou, tub of my heart?" cried
the girl; and she dived under the bed, and
pulled out the third reason for her choosing
this room. Her mother, she knew, would
not change for anything the comfortable
"sitz," the friend of many years; so Hildegarde
felt at full liberty to enjoy this great
white porcelain tub, shallow, three feet across,
with red and blue fishes swimming all over it.
She did not know that Captain Robert Aytoun
had brought it in the hold of his ship all the
way from Singapore, for his little Hester, but
she did know that it was the most delightful
tub she had ever dreamed of; and as she
splashed the crystal water about, she almost
ceased, for the first time, to regret the blue
river which had been her daily bathing-place
the summer before. Very fresh and sweet
she looked, when at last the long locks were
braided in one great smooth braid, and the
pretty grey gingham put on and smoothed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
down. She nodded cheerfully to her image
in the glass. It was, as dear Cousin Wealthy
said, a privilege to be good-looking, and Hildegarde
was simply and honestly glad of her
beauty.</p>

<p>"Now," she said, when the room was
"picked up," and everything a&euml;rable hung up
to air, "the question is, Go out first and arrange
the Penates after breakfast, or arrange
the Penates now and go out later?" One
more glance from the window decided the
matter. "They must wait, poor dears! After
all, it is more respectful to take them out
when the room is made up than when it is
having its sheet and pillow-case party, like
this."</p>

<p>She went down her own staircase with a
proud sense of possession, and opening the
door at its foot, found herself in a little covered
porch, from which a flagged walk led
toward the back of the house. Here was a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
pleasant sort of yard, partly covered with
broad flags, with a grassy space beyond.
Here were clothes-lines, well, and woodshed;
and here was auntie, standing at her kitchen
door, and looking well satisfied with her new
quarters.</p>

<p>"What a pleasant yard, auntie!" said Hildegarde.
"This is your own domain, isn't
it?"</p>

<p>"Reckon 'tis!" replied the good woman,
smiling. "Jes' suits me, dis does. I kin
have some chickens here, and do my washin'
out-doors, and spread out some, 'stead o' bein'
cooped up like a old hen myself."</p>

<p>A high wall surrounded auntie's domain,
and Hildegarde looked round it wonderingly.</p>

<p>"Oh! there is a door," she said. "I
thought mamma said there was a garden.
That must be it, beyond there. Call me when
breakfast is ready, please, auntie." Passing
through the door, she closed it after her,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
and entered&mdash;another world. A dim, green
world, wholly different from the golden,
sunny one she had just left; a damp world,
where the dew lay heavy on shrubs and borders,
and dripped like rain from the long,
pendent branches of the trees. The paths
were damp, and covered with fine green moss.
Great hedges of box grew on either side, untrimmed,
rising as high as the girl's head;
and as she walked between them their cool
glossy leaves brushed against her cheek.
Here and there was a neglected flower-bed,
where a few pallid rosebuds looked sadly
out, and pinks flung themselves headlong
over the border, as if trying to reach the
sunlight; but for the most part the box and
the great elms and locusts had it their own
way. Hildegarde had never seen such
locust-trees! They were as tall as the elms,
their trunks scarred and rough with the
frosts of many winters. No birds sang in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
their green, whispering depths; the silence
of the place was heavy, weighted down with
memories of vanished things.</p>

<p>"I have no right to come here!" said
Hildegarde to herself. "I am sure they
would not like it." Something white glimmered
between the bending boughs of box
which interlaced across her path. She half
expected to see a shadowy form confront her
and wave her back; but, pushing on, she saw
a neglected summer-house, entirely covered
with the wild clematis called virgin's-bower.
She peeped in, but did not venture across
the threshold, because it looked as if there
might be spiders in it. Through the opposite
door, however, she caught a glimpse of
a very different prospect, a flash of yellow
sunlight, a sunny meadow stretching up and
away. Skirting the summer-house carefully,
she came upon a stone wall, the boundary
of the garden, beyond which the broad<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
meadow lay full in the sunlight. Sitting
on this wall, Hildegarde felt as if half of
her were in one world, and half in the
other; for the dark box and the drooping
elm-branches came to the very edge of the
wall, while all beyond was rioting in morning
and sunshine.</p>

<div class='poem'>
"The new world and the old one,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">The green world and the gold one!"</span><br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'>she murmured, and smiled to find herself
dropping into poetry, like Silas Wegg.</div>

<p>At this moment a faint sound fell on her
ear, a far-away voice, which belonged wholly
to the golden world, and had nothing whatever
to do with the green. "Hi-ya! Miss
Hildy chile!" the mellow African voice came
floating down through the trees with an imperious
summons; and Hildegarde jumped
down from her stone perch, and came out
of her dream, and went in to breakfast.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<p>"And what is to be done, Mammina?"
asked Hildegarde, when the "eggs and the
ham and the strawberry jam" were things of
the past, and they were out on the piazza
again. "Do you realise, by the way, that we
shall live chiefly on this piazza?"</p>

<p>"It is certainly a most delightful place,"
said Mrs. Grahame. "And I do realise that
while it would be quite out of the question to
change anything in Miss Barbara's sacred
parlour, it is not exactly the place to be cosy
in. But, dear child, I shall have to be in my
own room a good deal, as this arranging of
your dear father's papers will be my chief
work through the summer, probably."</p>

<p>"Oh, of course! and I shall be in my room
a good deal, for there is sewing, and all that
German I am going to read, and&mdash;oh, and
quantities of things to do! But still we
shall live here a great deal, I am sure. It is
just a great pleasant room, with one side of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
it taken off. And it is very quiet, with the
strip of lawn, and the ledge beyond. One
cannot see the road, except just a bit through
the gate. Sometimes you can bring your
writing down here, and I can grub in the
flower-bed and disturb you."</p>

<p>"Thank you!" said her mother, laughing.
"The prospect is singularly attractive. But,
dear, you asked me a few minutes ago what
was to be done. I thought it would be pleasant
if we took out our various little belongings,
and disposed them here and there."</p>

<p>"Just what I was longing to do!" cried
Hildegarde. "All my precious alicumtweezles
are crying out from the trunk, and waiting
for me. But don't you want me to see the
butcher for you, love, or let auntie tell me
what she is going to make for dessert, or
perform any other sacred after-breakfast
rites?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Grahame shook her head, smiling, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
Hildegarde flew upstairs, like an arrow shot
from a bow.</p>

<p>In her room stood a huge trunk, already
unlocked and unstrapped, and a box whose
aspect said plainly that it contained books.
All the dresses had been taken out the day
before and hung in the roomy closet, pretty,
simple gowns, mostly white or grey, for the
dear father had disliked "mourning" extremely.
Now Hildegarde took out her hats,
the broad-brimmed straw with the white daisy
wreath, the pretty white shirred mull for best,
the black "rough and ready" sailor for common
wear. These were laid carefully on a
shelf in the closet, and covered with a light
cloth to keep them from dust. This done
as a matter of duty, the pleasant part began.
One after another, a most astonishing array of
things were taken from the trunk and laid on
the bed, which spread a broad white surface
to receive them: a trinket-box of ebony and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
silver; a plaster cast of the Venus of Milo,
another of the Pompeian Psyche, both
"treated" in some way that gave them the
smooth lustre of old ivory; a hideous little
Indian idol, carved out of dark wood, with
eyes of real carbuncle; a doll's tea-set of
exquisite blue and white china, brought to
Hildegarde from Pekin by a wandering uncle,
when she was eight years old; a stuffed
hawk, confidently asserted by its owner to be
the original "jolly gosshawk" of the Scottish
ballad, which could "speak and flee"; a Swiss
cuckoo clock; several great pink-lipped shells;
a butterfly net; a rattlesnake's skin; an exquisite
statuette of carved wood, representing
Theodoric, King of the Ostrogoths, a copy
of the famous bronze statue at Innsbruck; a
large assortment of pasteboard boxes, of all
sizes and shapes; three or four work-baskets;
last of all, some framed photographs and
engravings, and a number of polished pieces<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
of wood, which were speedily put together
into a bookcase and two or three hanging
shelves. On these shelves and on the mantel-piece
the various alicumtweezles were arranged
and re-arranged, till at length Hildegarde
gave a satisfied nod and pronounced
them perfect. "But now comes the hard
part!" she said. "The pictures! Who shall
have the post of honour over the mantel-piece?
Come here, dear persons, and let me look at
you!" She took up two engravings, both
framed in gilt laurel leaves, and studied them
attentively. One was the portrait of a man
in cavalier dress, strikingly handsome, with
dark, piercing eyes and long, curling hair.
The expression of the face was melancholy,
almost sombre; yet there was a strange fascination
in its stern gaze. On the margin was
written,&mdash;</p>

<div class='center'>
"John Grahame of Claverhouse,<br />
"Viscount Dundee."<br />
</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<div class='unindent'>The other portrait showed an older man, clad
in a quaint dress, with a hat that would have
been funny on any other head, but seemed not
out of place here. The face was not beautiful,
but calm and strong, with earnest,
thoughtful eyes, and a firm mouth and chin.
The legend bore, in curious black-letter, the
words,&mdash;</div>

<div class='center'>
"William of Orange Nassau,<br />
"Hereditary Grand Stadt-holder of the Netherlands."<br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'>No one save Hildegarde knew that on the
back of this picture, turned upside down in
perpetual disgrace and ridicule, was a hideous
little photograph of Philip II. of Spain. It
was a constant gratification to her to know
that it was there, and she occasionally, as
now, turned it round and made insulting
remarks to it. She hoped the great Oranger
liked to know of this humiliation of his country's
foe; but William the Silent kept his
own counsel, as was always his way.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></div>

<p>And now the question was, Which hero was
to have the chief place?</p>

<p>"You are the great one, of course, my
saint!" said Hildegarde, gazing into the calm
eyes of the majestic Dutchman, "and we all
know it. But you see, he is an ancestor, and
so many people hate him, poor dear!"</p>

<p>She looked from one to the other, till the
fixed gaze of the pictured eyes grew really
uncomfortable, and she fancied that she saw
a look of impatience in those of the Scottish
chieftain. Then she looked again at the
space above the mantel-piece, and, after measuring
it carefully with her eyes, came to a
new resolution.</p>

<p>"You see," she said, taking up a third picture,
a beautiful photograph of the Sistine
Madonna, "I put <i>her</i> in the middle, and you
on each side, and then neither of you can
say a word."</p>

<p>This arrangement gave great satisfaction;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
and the other pictures, the Correggio cherubs,
Kaulbach's "Lili," the Raphael "violin-player,"
and "St. Cecilia," were easily disposed
of on the various panels, while over
the dressing-table, where she could see it
from her bed, was a fine print of Murillo's
lovely "Guardian Angel."</p>

<p>Hildegarde drew a long breath of satisfaction
as she looked round on her favourites in
their new home. "So dear they are!" she
said fondly. "I wish Hester could see them.
Don't you suppose she had <i>any</i> pictures?
There are no marks of any on the wall.
Well, and now for the books!"</p>

<p>Hammer and screwdriver were brought,
and soon the box was opened and the books
in their places. Would any girls like to know
what Hildegarde's books are? Let us take
a glance at them, as they stand in neat rows
on the plain, smooth shelves. Those big volumes
on the lowest shelf are Scudder's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
"Butterflies," a highly valued work, full of
coloured plates, over which Hildegarde sighs
with longing rapture; for, from collecting
moths and butterflies for her friend, Bubble
Chirk, she has become an ardent collector
herself, and in one of the unopened cases
downstairs is an oak cabinet with glass-covered
drawers, very precious, containing
several hundred "specimens."</p>

<p>Here is "Robin Hood," and Gray's Botany,
and Percy's "Reliques," and a set of George
Eliot, and one of Charles Kingsley, and the
"Ingoldsby Legends," and Aytoun's "Lays of
the Scottish Cavaliers," which looks as if it
had been read almost to pieces, as indeed it
has. (There is a mark laid in at the "Burial
March of Dundee," which Hildegarde is learning
by heart. This young woman has a
habit of keeping a book of poetry open on
her dressing-table when she is doing her hair,
and learning verses while she brushes out<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
her long locks. It is a pleasant habit, though
it does not tend to accelerate the toilet.)</p>

<p>On the next shelf is "Cranford," also well
thumbed, and everything that Mrs. Ewing
ever wrote, and "Betty Leicester," and Miss
Yonge's historical stories, and the "Tales of
a Grandfather," and "Lorna Doone," and the
dear old "Days of Bruce," and "Scottish
Chiefs," side by side with the "Last of the
Barons," and the "Queens of England," and the
beloved Homer, in Derby's noble translation,
also in brown leather. Here, too, is "Sesame
and Lilies," and Carlyle on Hero-Worship.</p>

<p>The upper shelf is entirely devoted to
poetry, and here are Longfellow and Tennyson,
of course, and Milton (<i>not</i> "of course"),
and Scott (in tatters, worse off than Aytoun),
and Shelley and Keats, and the Jacobite
Ballads, and Allingham's Ballad Book, and
Mrs. Browning, and "Sir Launfal," and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
"Golden Treasury," and "Children's Garland."
There is no room for the handy
volume Shakespeare, so he and his box must
live on top of the bookcase, with his own
bust on one side and Beethoven's on the other.
These are flanked in turn by photographs
of Sir Walter, with Maida at his feet, and
Edwin Booth as Hamlet, both in those pretty
glass frames which are almost as good as no
frame at all.</p>

<p>"And if you are not a pleasant sight,"
said Hildegarde, falling back to survey her
work, and addressing the collection comprehensively,
"then I never saw one, that's all.
<i>Isn't</i> it nice, dear persons?" she continued,
turning to the portraits, which from
their places over the mantel-piece had a full
view of the bookcase.</p>

<p>But the persons expressed no opinion. Indeed,
I am not sure that William the Silent
could read English; and Dundee's knowledge<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
of literature was slight, if we may judge
from his spelling. I should not, however,
wish Hildegarde to hear me say this.</p>

<p>Failing to elicit a response from her two
presiding heroes, our maiden turned to Sir
Walter, who always knew just how things
were; and from this the natural step was to
the "Lay of the Last Minstrel" (which she
had not read so <i>very</i> lately, she thought,
with a guilty glance at the trunk and box,
which stood in the middle of the room, yawning
to be put away), and there was an end
of Hildegarde till dinner-time.</p>

<p>"And that is why I was late, dear love!"
she said, as after a hasty explanation of the
above related doings, she sank down in her
chair at the dinner-table, and gave a furtive
pat to her hair, which she had smoothed
rather hurriedly. "You know you would
have brained me with the hammer, if I had
not put it away, and that the tacks would<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
have been served up on toast for my supper.
Such is your ferocious disposition."</p>

<p>Mrs. Grahame smiled as she helped Hildegarde
to soup. "Suppose a stranger should
pass by that open window and hear your
remarks," she said. "A pretty idea he
would have of my maternal care. After all,
my desire is to keep tacks <i>out</i> of your food.
How long ago was it that I found a button
in the cup of tea which a certain young
woman of my acquaintance brought me?"</p>

<p>"Ungenerous!" exclaimed Hildegarde with
tragic fervour. "It was only a glove-button.
It dropped off my glove, and it would not
have disagreed with you in the least. I
move that we change the subject." And at
that moment in came Janet with the veal
cutlets.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>A WALK AND AN ADVENTURE.</div>


<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">One</span> lovely afternoon, after they were well
settled, and all the unpacking was done, Hildegarde
started out on an exploration tour.
She and her mother had already taken one or
two short walks along the road near which
their house stood, and had seen the brand-new
towers of Mrs. Loftus's house, "pricking a
cockney ear" on the other side of the way,
and had caught a glimpse of an old vine-covered
mansion, standing back from the
road and almost hidden by great trees, which
her mother said was Colonel Ferrers's house.</div>

<p>But now Hildegarde wanted a long tramp;
she wanted to explore that sunny meadow<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
that lay behind the green garden, and the
woods that fringed the meadow again beyond.
So she put on a short corduroy skirt, that
would not tear when it caught on the bushes,
slung a tin plant-box over her shoulder, kissed
her mother, who had a headache and could
not go, and started off in high spirits. She
was singing as she ran down the stairs and
through auntie's sunny back yard, and the martial
strains of "Bonny Dundee" rang merrily
through the clear June air; but as she closed
the garden door behind her, the song died
away, for "one would as soon sing in a
churchyard," she thought, "as in the Ladies'
Garden." So she passed silently along between
the box hedges, her footsteps making
no sound on the mossy path, only the
branches rustling softly as she put them aside.
The afternoon sun sent faint gleams of pallid
gold down through the branches of the great
elm; they were like the ghosts of sunbeams.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
Her ear caught the sound of falling water,
which she had not noticed before; she turned
a corner, and lo! there was a dusky ravine,
and a little dark stream falling over the
rocks, and flowing along with a sullen murmur
between banks of fern. It was part of
the green world. The mysterious sadness of
the deserted garden was here, too, and Hildegarde
felt her glad spirits going down, down,
as if an actual weight were pressing on her.
But she shook off the oppression. "I will
not!" she said. "I will not be enchanted
to-day! Another day I will come and sit
here, and the stream will tell me all the
mournful story; I know it will if I sit long
enough. But to-day I want joy, and sunshine,
and cheerful things. Good-by, dear
ladies! I hope you won't mind!" and grasping
the hanging bough of a neighbouring elm,
she swung herself easily down into the
meadow.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>

<p>It was a very pleasant meadow. The grass
was long, so long that Hildegarde felt rather
guilty at walking through it, and framed a
mental apology to the farmer as she went
along. It was full of daisies and sorrel, so it
was not his best mowing-field, she thought.
She plucked a daisy and pulled off the petals
to see whether Rose loved her, and found she
did not, which made her laugh in a foolish,
happy way, since she knew better. Now she
came to a huge sycamore-tree, a veritable
giant, all scarred with white patches where
the bark had dropped off. Beside it lay
another, prostrate. The branches had been
cut off, but the vast trunk showed that it had
been even taller than the one which was now
standing. "Baucis and Philemon!" said
Hildegarde. "Poor dears! One is more
sorry for the one who is left, I think, than for
the fallen one. To see him lying here with
his head off, and not to be able to do anything<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
about it! She cannot even 'tear her ling-long
yellow hair'&mdash;only it is green. I wonder
who killed him." And she went on,
murmuring to herself,&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'>
"They shot him dead on the Nine-Stane Rigg,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Beside the Headless Cross.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And they left him lying in his blood</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Upon the moor and moss,"</span><br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'>as if Barthram's Dirge had anything to do
with the story of Baucis and Philemon. But
this young woman's head was very full of
ballads and scraps of old songs, and she was
apt to break into them on any or no pretext.
She went on now with her favourite dirge,
half reciting, half chanting it, as she mounted
the sunny slope before her.</div>

<div class='poem'>
"They made a bier of the broken bough,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">The sauch and the aspen grey,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And they bore him to the Lady Chapel</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">And waked him there all day.</span><br />
<br />
"A lady came to that lonely bower,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">And threw her robes aside.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">She tore her ling-long yellow hair,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">And knelt at Barthram's side.</span><br />
<br />
"She bathed him in the Lady-Well,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">His wounds sae deep and sair,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And she plaited a garland for his breast,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">And a garland for his hair.</span><br />
<br />
"They rowed him in a lily-sheet<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">And bare him to his earth,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And the grey friars sung the dead man's mass,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">As they passed the Chapel Garth.</span><br />
<br />
"They buried him at the mirk midnight,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">When the dew fell cold and still;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">When the aspen grey forgot to play,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">And the mist clung to the hill.</span><br />
<br />
"They dug his grave but a bare foot deep<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">By the edge of the Nine-Stane Burn,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And they covered him o'er with the heather flower,</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">The moss and the lady fern.</span><br />
<br />
"A grey friar stayed upon the grave<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">And sung through the morning tide.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And a friar shall sing for Barthram's soul</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">While Headless Cross shall bide."</span><br />
</div>

<p>Now she had reached the fringe of trees at
the top of the slope, and found that it was the
beginning of what looked like a considerable
wood. "A pine wood!" said Hildegarde,
sniffing the spicy perfume with delight. "Oh,
pleasant place! No plants, but one cannot
have everything. Oh! how good it smells!
and hark to the sound of the sea! I shall call
this Ramoth Hill." She walked along, keeping
near the edge of the wood, where it was
still warm and luminous with sunshine. Now
she looked up into the murmuring cloud of
branches above her, now she looked down at
the burnished needles which made a soft,
thick carpet under her feet; and she said
again, "Oh, pleasant place!" Presently, in
one of the upward glances, she stopped short.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
Her look, from carelessly wandering, became
keen and intent. On one of the branches of
the tree under which she stood was a small,
round object. "A nest!" said Hildegarde.
"The question is, What nest?" She walked
round and round the tree, like a pointer who
has "treed" a partridge; but no bird rose
from the nest, nor could she see at all what
manner of nest it was. Finding this to be
the case, she transferred her scrutiny from the
nest to the tree. It was a sturdy pine, with
strong, broad branches jutting out, the lowest
not so very far above her head, a most
attractive tree, from every point of view.
Hildegarde leaned against the trunk for a
moment, smiling to herself, and listening to
the "two voices." "You are seventeen years
old," said one voice. "Not quite," said the
other. "Not for a month yet. Besides,
what if I were?" "Suppose some one should
come by and see you?" said the first voice.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
"But no one will," replied the second.
"And perhaps you can't do it, anyhow,"
continued the first; "it would be ridiculous
to try, and fail." "Just wait and see!" said
the second voice. And when it had said that,
Hildegarde climbed the tree.</p>

<p>I shall not describe exactly how she did it,
for it may not have been in the most approved
style of the art; but she got up, and seated
herself on the broad, spreading branch, not so
very much out of breath, all things considered,
and with only two scratches worth mentioning.
After a moment's triumphant repose, she
worked her way upward to where the nest was
firmly fixed in a crotch, and bent eagerly over
it. A kingbird's nest! this was great joy, for
she had never found one before. There were
five eggs in it, and she gazed with delight at
the perfect little things. But when she touched
them gently, she found them quite cold. The
nest was deserted. "Bad little mother!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
said Hildegarde. "How could you leave the
lovely things? Such a perfect place to bring
up a family in, too!" She looked around
her. It was very pleasant up in this airy
bower. Great level branches stretched above
and below her, roof and floor of soft, dusky
plumes. The keen, exquisite fragrance seemed
to fold round her like a cloud; she felt fairly
steeped in warmth and perfume. Sitting
curled up on the great bough, her back resting
against the trunk, the girl fell into a
pleasant waking dream, her thoughts wandering
idly here and there, and the sound of
the sea in her ears. She was an enchanted
princess, shut in a green tower by the sea.
The sea loved her, and sang to her all day
long the softest song he knew, and no angry
waves ever came to make clamour and confusion.
By and by a rescuer would come,&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'>
"A fairy prince, with joyful eyes,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And lighter-footed than the fox."</span><br />
</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>

</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>

<div class='unindent'>He would stand beneath the green tower, and
call to her:&mdash;</div>

<p>"Hallo, there! you young rascal, come
down! How dare you rob birds' nests in my
woods?"</p>

<p>The voice was deep and stern, and Hildegarde
started so violently that she nearly fell
from her perch. She could not speak for the
moment, but she looked down, and saw a
fierce-looking old gentleman, clad in a black
velvet coat and spotless white trousers, brandishing
a thick stick, and peering with angry,
short-sighted eyes up into the tree.</p>

<p>"Come down, I say!" he repeated sternly.
"I'll teach you to rob my nests, you young
vagabond!"</p>

<p>This was really not to be endured.</p>

<p>"I am <i>not</i> robbing the nest, sir!" cried
Hildegarde, indignation overcoming her alarm.
"I never did such a thing in my life. And I&mdash;I
am not a boy!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<p>"Harry Monmouth!" exclaimed the old
gentleman. "I beg ten thousand pardons!
What are you?"</p>

<p>Hildegarde's first impulse was to say that
she lived in Alaska (that being the most distant
place she could think of), and was on her
way thither; but fortunately the second
thought came quickly, and she replied with
as much dignity as the situation allowed:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I am the daughter of Mrs. Hugh Grahame.
I live at Braeside" (I have forgotten
to mention that this was the name of
the new home), "and have wandered off our
own grounds without knowing it. I am extremely
sorry to be trespassing, but&mdash;but&mdash;I
only wanted to see what kind of nest it was."</p>

<p>She stopped suddenly, feeling that there
was a little sob somewhere about her, and
that she would die rather than let it get
into her voice. The old gentleman took off
his hat.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<p>"My dear young lady," he said, "the
apologies are all on my side. Accept ten
thousand of them, I beg of you! I am
delighted to make the acquaintance of Mrs.
Grahame's daughter, under&mdash;a&mdash;any circumstances."
(Here he evidently suppressed
a chuckle, and Hildegarde knew it, and hated
him.) "Permit me to introduce myself,&mdash;Colonel
Ferrers.</p>

<p>"I have been annoyed lately," he added
kindly, "by thieving boys, and, being near-sighted,
did not distinguish between a persecutor
and a protector of my birds." He
bowed again. "And now I will continue my
walk, merely remarking that I beg you to consider
yourself entirely free of my grounds, in
any and every part. I shall do myself the
honour of calling on your mother very shortly.
Good-morning, my dear Miss Grahame!"
and, with another bow, Colonel Ferrers replaced
his felt wide-awake, and strode off<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
across the meadow, flourishing his stick, and
indulging in the chuckle which he had so
long suppressed.</p>

<p>"Harry Monmouth!" he said to himself,
as he switched the daisy-heads off. "So we
have a fair tomboy for a neighbour. Well, it
may be a good thing for Jack. I must take
him over and introduce him."</p>

<p>Now Hildegarde was not in the least a
tomboy, as we know; and the intuitive
knowledge that the old gentleman would
think her one made her very angry indeed.
She waited till he was out of sight, and then
slid down the tree, without a second glance
at the kingbird's nest, the innocent cause of
all the trouble. She had meant to take one
egg, to add to her collection; but she would
not touch one now, if there were a thousand
of them. She ran down the long sunny
slope of the meadow, her cheeks glowing,
her heart still beating angrily. She was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
going straight home, to tell her mother all
about it, and how horrid Colonel Ferrers had
been, and how she should never come downstairs
when he came to the house&mdash;never!
"under any circumstances!" How dared
he make fun of her? She sat down on the
stone wall to rest, and thought how her
mother would hear the tale with sympathetic
indignation. But somehow&mdash;how was it?&mdash;when
she conjured up her mother's face,
there was a twinkle in her eye. Mamma had
such a fatal way of seeing the funny side of
things. Suppose she should only laugh at this
dreadful adventure! Perhaps&mdash;perhaps it <i>was</i>
funny, from Colonel Ferrers's point of view.</p>

<p>In short, by the time she reached home,
Hildegarde had cooled off a good deal, and
it was a modified version of the tragedy that
Mrs. Grahame heard. She found this quite
funny enough, however, and Hildegarde was
almost, but not quite, ready to laugh with her.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>

<p>That evening, mother and daughter were
sitting on the broad verandah as usual, playing
Encyclop&aelig;dics. This was a game of Mrs.
Grahame's own invention, and a favourite
resource with her and Hildegarde in darkling
hours like this. Perhaps some of my readers
may like to know how the game is played,
and, as the Dodo says of the Caucus Race,
"the best way to explain it is to play it."</p>

<p>They began with the letter "A," and had
already been playing some time, turn and
turn about.</p>

<p>"Aphrodite, goddess of Love and Beauty."</p>

<p>"Ahasuerus, king of Persia, <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> something
or other, afflicted with sleeplessness."</p>

<p>"Alfred the Great, unsuccessful tender of
cakes."</p>

<p>"&AElig;neas, pious; from the flames of Troy
did on his back the old Anchises bear; also
deserted Dido."</p>

<p>"Ananias, liar."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p>"Anacreon, Greek poet."</p>

<p>"Allan-a-dale, minstrel and outlaw."</p>

<p>"Andromache, wife of Hector."</p>

<p>"Astyanax, son of the same."</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;don't you think it's time to go on
to B?" asked Hildegarde.</p>

<p>"I have several more A's," replied her
mother.</p>

<p>"Well, my initials are not 'B. U.,'" said
the girl, "but perhaps I can manage one or
two more."</p>

<p>"B. U.?"</p>

<p>"Yes! Biographic Universelle, of course,
dear. Artaxerxes, also king of Persia."</p>

<p>"Anne of Geierstein."</p>

<p>"Arabella Stuart."</p>

<p>"Ap Morgan, Ap Griffith, Ap Hugh, Ap
Tudor, Ap Rice, quoth his roundelay."</p>

<p>"Oh! oh! that was one of my reserves.
Azrael, the angel of death."</p>

<p>"Agamemnon, king of men."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>

<p>"Alecto, Fury."</p>

<p>"Agag, who came walking delicately."</p>

<p>"Addison, Joseph, writer."</p>

<p>"Antony, Mark, Roman general, lover of
Cleopatra."</p>

<p>"'Amlet, Prince of&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hilda!" cried Mrs. Grahame. "For
shame! It is certainly high time to go on to
B, if you are going to behave in this way,
and I shall put <i>e d</i> after it."</p>

<p>"Oh, no!" said Hildegarde, "I will be
good. It isn't nine o'clock yet, I know.
Buccleugh, Bold, Duke of, Warden here o'
the Scottish side. I was determined to get
him first."</p>

<p>"Balaam, prophet."</p>

<p>"Beatrice, in 'Much Ado about Nothing.'"</p>

<p>"Beatrix Esmond."</p>

<p>"Bruce, Robert, King of Scotland."</p>

<p>"Burns, Robert, King of Scottish poets."</p>

<p>"Oh! oh! well, I suppose he is!" Hilda<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
admitted reluctantly. "But Sir Walter makes
an admirable viceroy. I think&mdash;who is
that? Mamma, there is some one coming up
the steps."</p>

<p>"Mrs. Grahame?" said a deep voice, as
two shadowy forms emerged from the darkness.
"I am delighted to meet you again.
You remember Colonel Ferrers?"</p>

<p>"Perfectly!" said Mrs. Grahame, cordially,
advancing and holding out her hand. "I am
very glad to see you. Colonel Ferrers,&mdash;though
I hardly do see you!" she added, laughing.
"Hildegarde, here is Colonel Ferrers, whom
you met this morning."</p>

<p>"Good evening!" said Hildegarde, thinking
that mamma was very cruel.</p>

<p>"Delighted!" said Colonel Ferrers, bowing
again; and he added, "May I be allowed
to present my nephew? Mrs. Grahame, Miss
Grahame, my nephew, John Ferrers."</p>

<p>A tall figure bowed awkwardly, and a voice<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
murmured something which might have been
a greeting in English, Choctaw, or pure Polynesian,
as it was wholly unintelligible.</p>

<p>"It is too pleasant an evening to spend in
the house," said Mrs. Grahame. "I think
you will find chairs, gentlemen, by a little
judicious groping. Oh! I trust you are not
hurt, Mr. Ferrers?" For Mr. Ferrers had
tumbled over his chair, and was now sprawling
at full length on the piazza. He gathered
himself up again, apparently too much abashed
to say a word.</p>

<p>"Oh! he's all right!" said Colonel Ferrers,
laughing. "He's always tumbling about;
just got his growth, you see, and hasn't
learned what to do with it. Well, many
things have happened since we met, Mrs.
Grahame; we won't say how many years it is."</p>

<p>"Many things, indeed!" said Mrs. Grahame
with a sigh.</p>

<p>"Yes! yes!" said Colonel Ferrers. "Poor<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
Grahame! met him last year in town; never
saw him looking better. Well, so it goes.
Changing world, my dear Madame! Poor
Aytoun, too! I miss him sadly. My only
neighbour. We have been together a great
deal since his sisters died. Yes! yes! very
glad I was to hear that he had left the property
to you. Not another soul to speak to
in the neighbourhood."</p>

<p>"Who lives in the large new house across
the way?" asked Mrs. Grahame. "I know
the name of the family is Loftus, but nothing
more."</p>

<p>"Parcel of fools, I call 'em!" said Colonel
Ferrers, contemptuously. "New people, with
money. Loftus, sharp business man, wants
to be a gentleman farmer. As much idea of
farming as my stick has. Wife and daughters
look like a parcel o' fools. Don't know
'em! don't want to know 'em!" Mrs. Grahame,
finding this not an agreeable subject,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
turned the conversation upon old friends, and
they were soon deep in matters of twenty
years ago.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Hildegarde and the bashful
youth had sat in absolute silence. At first
Hildegarde had been too much discomposed by
her mother's allusion to the morning's adventure
to speak, though she was able to see
afterwards how much better it was to bring
up the matter naturally, and then dismiss it
as a thing of no consequence, as it was, than
to let it hang, an unacknowledged cloud, in
the background.</p>

<p>As the moments went on, however, she
became conscious that it was her duty to
entertain Mr. Ferrers. He evidently had no
idea of saying anything; her mother and
Colonel Ferrers had forgotten the presence of
either of them, apparently. The silence became
more and more awkward. What could
she say to this gawky youth, whose face she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
could not even see? "What a lovely day it
has been!" she finally remarked, and was
startled by the sound of her own voice,
though she was not usually shy in the least.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Mr. Ferrers, "it has been a
fine day."</p>

<p>Silence again. This would never do! "Do
you play tennis?" she asked boldly.</p>

<p>"No&mdash;not much!" was the reply.
"Doesn't pay, in hot weather."</p>

<p>This was not encouraging, but Hildegarde
was fairly roused by this time, and had no
idea of being beaten. "What <i>do</i> you do?"
she said.</p>

<p>Mr. Ferrers was silent, as if considering.</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;I don't know!" he said finally.
"Nothing much. Poke about!" Then, after
a pause, he added in explanation, "I don't
live here. I only came a few days ago. I
am to spend the summer with my uncle."
Apparently this effort was too much for him,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
for he relapsed into silence, and Hildegarde
could get nothing more save "Yes!" and
"No!" out of him. But now Colonel Ferrers
came to the rescue.</p>

<p>"By the way, Mrs. Grahame," he said, "I
think this boy must be a relation of yours, a
Scotch cousin at least. His mother was a
Grahame, daughter of Robert Grahame of Baltimore.
His own name is John Grahame
Ferrers."</p>

<p>"Is it possible?" cried Mrs. Grahame,
greatly surprised. "If that is the case, he is
much more than a Scotch cousin. Why,
Robert Grahame was my dear husband's first
cousin. Their fathers were brothers. Hugh
often spoke of his cousin Robert, and regretted
that they never met, as they were great friends
in their boyhood. And this is his son! is it
possible? My dear boy, I must shake hands
with you again. You <i>are</i> a boy, aren't you,
though you are so big?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>

<p>"To be sure he is a boy!" said Colonel
Ferrers, who was highly delighted with his
discovery of a relationship. "Just eighteen&mdash;a
mere snip of a boy! Going to college
in the autumn."</p>

<p>"Hildegarde," continued Mrs. Grahame,
"shake hands with your cousin John, and
tell him how glad you are to find him."</p>

<p>Hildegarde held out her hand, and John
Ferrers tried to find it, but found a hanging-basket
instead, and knocked it over, sending
a shower of damp earth over the other members
of the party.</p>

<p>"I must take him home," exclaimed Colonel
Ferrers, in mock despair, "or he will destroy
the whole house. Miss Hildegarde," he added,
in a very kind voice, "you probably thought
me an ogre this morning. I am generally
regarded as such. Fact is, you frightened
me more than I frightened you. We are not
used to seeing young ladies here who know<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
how to climb trees. Harry Monmouth! Wish
I could climb 'em myself as I used. Best fun
in the world! Come, Jack, I must get you
home before you do any more mischief. Good-night,
Mrs. Grahame! I trust we shall meet
often!"</p>

<p>"I trust so, indeed!" said Mrs. Grahame
heartily. "We shall count upon your being
neighbourly, in the good old country sense;
and as for John, he must do a cousin's duty
by us, and shall in return receive the freedom
of the house."</p>

<p>"Hum mum mum!" said John; at least,
that is what it sounded like; on which his
uncle seized him by the arm impatiently, and
walked him off.</p>

<p>"Well, Mammina!" said Hildegarde, when
the visitors were well out of hearing.</p>

<p>"Well, dear!" replied her mother placidly.
"What a pleasant visit! The poor lad is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
very shy, isn't he? Could you make anything
out of him?"</p>

<p>"Why, Mammina, he is a perfect goose!"
exclaimed Hildegarde, warmly. "<i>I</i> don't
think it was a pleasant visit at all. As to
making anything out of that&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Fair and softly!" said Mrs. Grahame
quietly. "In the first place, we will not criticise
the guests who have just left us, because
that is not pretty-behaved, as auntie would
say. And in the second place&mdash;your dear
father was just eighteen when I first met him,
Hildegarde; and he put his foot through the
flounce of my gown, upset strawberries and
cream into my lap, and sat down on my new
ivory fan, all at one tea-party."</p>

<p>"Good-night, dear mamma!" said Hildegarde
meekly.</p>

<p>"Good-night, my darling! and don't forget
that barn-door rent in your corduroy skirt,
when you get up in the morning."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>UNCLE AND NEPHEW.</div>


<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">Colonel Ferrers</span> and his nephew walked
away together, the former with a quick, military
stride, the latter shambling, as lads do
whose legs have outgrown their understanding
of them.</div>

<p>"Don't hunch, sir!" exclaimed the Colonel,
throwing his broad shoulders back and his
chin to the position of "eyes front." "Put
your chin in and your chest out, and don't
hunch! You have about as much carriage,
my nephew Jack, as a rheumatic camel.
Well!" (as poor Jack straightened his awkward
length and tried to govern his prancing
legs). "So Mrs. Grahame is a connection,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
after all; and a very charming woman, too.
And how did you find the young lady, sir?
Did she give you any points on tree-climbing?
Ho! ho! I was wrong, though, about
her being a tomboy. She hasn't the voice of
one. Did you notice her voice, nephew? it is
very sweet and melodious. It reminded me
of&mdash;of a voice I remember."</p>

<p>"I like her voice!" replied Jack Ferrers.
By the way, his own voice was a very pleasant
one, a well-bred and good-tempered voice.
"I couldn't see her face very well. I can't
talk to girls!" he added. "I don't know
what to say to them. Why did you tell them
about mother, Uncle Tom? There was no
need of their knowing."</p>

<p>"Why did I tell them?" exclaimed Colonel
Ferrers. "Harry Monmouth! I told them,
you young noodle, because I chose to tell
them, and because it was the truth, and a
mighty lucky thing for you, too. What with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
your poor mother's dying young, and your
father's astonishing and supernatural wrong-headedness,
you have had no bringing up
whatever, my poor fellow! Talk of your
going to college next year! why, you don't
know how to make a bow. I present you to
two charming women, and you double yourself
up as if you had been run through the
body, and then stumble over your own legs
and tumble over everything else. Shade of
Chesterfield! How am I to take you about,
if this is the way you behave?"</p>

<p>"It was dark," said poor Jack. "And&mdash;and
I don't want to be taken about, uncle,
thank you. Can't I just keep quiet while I
am here, and not see people? I don't know
how to talk, really I don't."</p>

<p>"Pooh! pooh! sir," roared the Colonel,
smiting the earth with his stick. "Have the
goodness to hold your tongue! You know
how to talk nonsense, and I request you'll<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
not do it to me. You are my brother's son,
sir, and I shall make it my business to teach
you to walk, and to talk, and to behave like
a rational Christian, while you are under my
roof. If your father had the smallest atom
of common sense in his composition&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Please don't say anything against father,
Uncle Tom," cried the lad. "I can't stand
that!" and one felt in the dark the fiery
flush that made his cheeks tingle.</p>

<p>"Upon my soul!" cried Colonel Ferrers
(who did not seem in the least angry), "you
are the most astounding young rascal it has
ever been my good fortune to meet. Are
you aware, sir, that your father is my brother?
that I first made the acquaintance of Raymond
Ferrers when he was one hour old,
a squeaking little scarlet wretch in a flannel
blanket? Are you aware of this, pray?"</p>

<p>"I suppose I am," answered the lad.
"But that doesn't make any difference. Nobody<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
body must say anything against him, even if
it is his own brother."</p>

<p>"Who is saying anything against him?"
demanded Colonel Ferrers, fiercely. "He is
an angel, sir; every idiot knows that. A
combination of angel and infant, Raymond
Ferrers is, and always has been. But the
combination does not qualify him for bringing
up children. Probatum est! Here we
are! Now let me see if you can open the
gate without fumbling, sir. If there is one
thing I can<i>not</i> endure, it is fumbling."</p>

<p>Thus adjured, Jack Ferrers opened the
heavy wooden gate, and the two passed
through a garden which seemed, from the
fragrance, to be full of roses. The old house
frowned dark and gloomy, with only one
light twinkling feebly in a lower window.
When they had entered, and were standing in
the pleasant library, book-lined from floor to
ceiling, Colonel Ferrers turned suddenly to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
his nephew, who was in a brown study, and
dealt him a blow on the shoulder which sent
him staggering half-way across the room, unexpected
as it was.</p>

<p>"You're right to stand up for your father,
my lad," he said, with gruff heartiness. "It
was unnecessary in this case, for I would be
cut into inch pieces and served up on toast if
it would do my brother Raymond any good;
but you are right all the same. If anybody
else ever says he hasn't common sense, knock
him down, do you hear? A blow from the
shoulder, sir! that's the proper answer."</p>

<p>"Yes, uncle," said the boy demurely; but
he looked up with a twinkle in his eye. "It's
lucky for me that I <i>don't</i> have to knock
you down, sir," he added. "You're awfully
strong, aren't you? I wish I were!"</p>

<p>"You, sir!" rejoined the Colonel. "You
have the frame of an ox, if you had any flesh
to cover it. Exercise is what you need,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
Nephew Jack! Fencing is what you want,
sir! Take that walking-stick! Harry Monmouth!
I'll give you a lesson, now. On
guard! So! defend yourself! Ha! humph!"
The last exclamation was one of disgust, for
at the Colonel's first thrust, Jack's stick flew
out of his hand, and knocked over a porcelain
vase, shattering it in pieces, Jack, meanwhile,
standing rubbing his arm and looking
very foolish.</p>

<p>"Humph!" repeated Colonel Ferrers, looking
rather disconcerted himself, and all the
more fierce therefore. "That comes of trying
to instruct a person who has not been taught
to hold himself together. You are a milksop,
my poor fellow! a sad milksop! but we are
going to change all that. There! never mind
about the pieces. Giuseppe will pick up the
pieces. Get your supper, and then go to bed."</p>

<p>"I don't care about supper, thank you,
uncle," said the lad.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span></p>

<p>"Pooh! pooh! don't talk nonsense!" cried
the Colonel. "You don't go to bed without
supper."</p>

<p>He led the way into the dining-room, a
long, low room, panelled with dark oak.
Walls, table, sideboard, shone like mirrors,
with the polish of many years. Over the
sideboard was the head of a gigantic moose,
with huge, spreading antlers. On the sideboard
itself were some beautiful pieces of old
silver, shining with the peculiar blue lustre
that comes from long rubbing, and from that
alone. A tray stood on the table, and on it
was a pitcher of milk, two glasses, and a plate
of very attractive-looking little cakes. The
colonel filled Jack's glass, and stood by with
grim determination till he had drunk every
drop.</p>

<p>"Now, a cake, sir," he added, sipping his
own glass leisurely. "A plummy cake, of
Mrs. Beadle's best make. Down with it, I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
insist!" In the matter of the plum cake,
little insistence was necessary, and between
uncle and nephew both plate and pitcher were
soon empty.</p>

<p>"There," said the good Colonel, as they
returned to the library, "now you have something
to sleep on, my friend. No empty
stomachs in this house, to distract people's
brains and make mooncalves of them. Ten
minutes' exercise with the Indian clubs&mdash;you
have them in your room?&mdash;and then to
bed. Hand me the 'Worthies of England,'
will you? Bookcase on the right of the door,
third shelf from the bottom, fifth book from
the left. Thomas Fuller. Yes, thank you.
Good-night, my boy! don't forget the clubs,
and <i>don't</i> poke your head forward like a ritualist
parson, because you are not otherwise
cut out for one."</p>

<p>Leaving his uncle comfortably established
with his book and reading-lamp, Jack Ferrers<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
took his way upstairs. It was not late, but
he had already found out that his uncle had
nothing to say to him or any one else after
the frugal nine o'clock supper, and his own
taste for solitude prompted him to seek his
room. As he passed along a dark corridor, a
gleam of light shot out from a half-open
door.</p>

<p>"Are you awake, Biddy?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Yes, dear!" answered a kind, hearty
voice. "Come in, Master Jack, if you've a
mind."</p>

<p>The room was so bright that Jack screwed
up his eyes for a moment. The lamp was
bright, the carpet was bright, the curtains
almost danced on the wall from their own
gayety, while the coloured prints, in shining
gilt frames, sang the whole gamut of colour
up and down and round and round. But
brighter than all else in the gay little room
was the gay little woman who sat by the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
round table (which answered every purpose
of a mirror), piecing a rainbow-coloured quilt.
Her face was as round and rosy as a Gravenstein
apple. She had bright yellow ribbons
in her lace cap, and her gown was of the
most wonderful merino that ever was seen,
with palm-leaves three inches long curling on
a crimson ground.</p>

<p>"How very bright you are in here, Biddy!"
said Jack, sitting down on the floor, with his
long legs curled under him. "You positively
make my eyes ache."</p>

<p>"It's cheerful, dear," replied the good
housekeeper. "I like to see things cheerful,
that I do. Will you have a drop of shrub,
Master Jack? there's some in the cupboard
there, and 'twill warm you up, like, before
going to bed."</p>

<p>Then, as Jack declined the shrub with
thanks, she continued, "And so you have
been to call on the ladies at Braeside, you and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
the Colonel. Ah! and very sweet ladies, I'm
told."</p>

<p>"Very likely!" said Jack absently. "Do
you mind if I pull the cat's tail, Biddy?"</p>

<p>He stretched out his hand toward a superb
yellow Angora cat which lay curled up on a
scarlet cushion, fast asleep.</p>

<p>"Oh! my dear!" cried Mrs. Beadle.
"Don't you do it! He's old, and his temper
not what it was. Poor old Sunshine! and
why would you pull his tail, you naughty
boy?"</p>

<p>"Oh! well&mdash;no matter!" said Jack.
"There's a fugue&mdash;that's a piece of music,
Biddy&mdash;that I am practising, called the 'Cat's
Fugue,' and I thought I would see if it really
sounded like a cat, that's all."</p>

<p>"Indeed, that's not such music as I should
like your uncle to hear!" exclaimed Mrs.
Beadle. "And what did you say to the
young lady, Master Jack?" she added, as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
she placed a scarlet block against a purple
one. "I'm glad enough you've found some
young company, to make you gay, like.
You're too quiet for a young lad, that you
are."</p>

<p>"Oh, bother!" responded Jack, shaking his
shoulders. "Tell me about my father, Biddy.
I don't believe he liked g&mdash;company, any
better than I do. What was he like when he
was a boy?"</p>

<p>"An angel!" said Mrs. Beadle fervently.
"An angel with his head in his pocket; that
is what Mr. Raymond was like."</p>

<p>"Uncle Tom called him an angel, too!"
said the lad. "Of course he is; a combination
of angel and&mdash;why did you say 'with
his head in his pocket,' Biddy?"</p>

<p>"Well, dear, it wasn't on his shoulders,"
replied the housekeeper. "He was in a
dream, like, all the time; oh, much worse
than you are yourself, Master Jack."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span></p>

<p>"Thank you!" muttered Jack.</p>

<p>"And forgetful! well! well! he needed to
be tied to some one, Mr. Raymond did. To
see him come in for his luncheon, and then
forget all about it, and stand with a book in
his hand, reading as if there was nothing else
in the world. And then Mr. Tom&mdash;dear!
dear! would put his head down and run and
butt him right in the stomach, and down they
would go together and roll over and over;
great big lads, like you, sir, and their father
would take the dog-whip and thrash 'em till
they got up. 'Twas all in sport like, d'ye see;
but Mr. Raymond never let go his book, only
beat Mr. Tom with it. Dear! dear! such
lads!"</p>

<p>"Tell me about his running away," said
Jack.</p>

<p>"After the fiddler, do you mean, dear?
That was when he was a little lad. Always
mad after music he was, and playing on anything<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
he could get hold of, and singing like a
serup, that boy. So one day there came
along an Italian, with a fiddle that he played
on, and a little boy along with him, that had
a fiddle, too. Well, and if Mr. Raymond
didn't persuade that boy to change clothes
with him, and he to stay here and Mr. Raymond
to go with the fiddler and learn to
play. Of course the man was a scamp, and
had no business; and Mr. Raymond gave
him his gold piece to take him, and all! But
when the old Squire&mdash;that's your grandfather,
dear!&mdash;when he came in and found that little
black-eyed fellow dressed in his son's clothes,
and crying with fright, and not a word of
English&mdash;well, he was neither to hold nor
to bind, as the saying is. Luckily Mrs. Ferrers&mdash;that's
your grandmother, dear! she
came in before the child was frightened into
a fit, though very near it; and she spoke the
language, and with her quiet ways she got<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
the child quiet, and he told her all about it,
and how the fiddler beat him, and showed
the great bruises. And when she told the
Squire, he got black in the face, like he used,
and took his dog-whip and rode off on his big
grey horse like mad; and when he came back
with Mr. Raymond in front of him, the whip
was all in pieces, and Mr. Raymond crying
and holding the little fiddle tight. And the
Italian boy stayed, and the Squire made a
man of him, from being a Papist outlandish-man.
And that's all the story, Master Jack."</p>

<p>"And he is Giuseppe?" asked Jack.</p>

<p>"And he is Jew Seppy," Mrs. Beadle
assented. "Though it seems a hard name
to give him, and no Jew blood in him that
any one can prove, only his eyes being black.
But he won't hear to its being shortened.
And now it is getting to be night-cap time,
Master Jack," said the good woman, beginning
to fold up her work, "and I hope you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
are going to bed, too, like a good young gentleman.
But if you don't, you'll shut the
door careful, won't you dear?"</p>

<p>"Never fear," said the boy, gathering
himself up from the floor. "I'm sleepy to-night,
anyhow; I may go straight to bed.
Good-night, Biddy. You're quite sure you
like me to call you 'Biddy'?"</p>

<p>"My dear, it makes me feel five-and-twenty
years younger!" said the good woman; "and
I seem to see your dear father, coming in
with his curls a-shaking, calling his Biddy.
Ah, well! Good-night, Master Jack, dear!
Don't forget to look in when you go by."</p>

<p>"Good-night, Biddy!"</p>

<p>The lad went off with his candle, fairly
stumbling along the corridor from sheer
sleepiness; but when he reached his own
room, which was flooded with moonlight, the
drowsiness seemed to take wings and disappear.
He sat down by the open window and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
looked out. Below lay the garden, all black
and silver in the intense white light. The
smell of the roses came up to him, exquisitely
sweet. He leaned his head against the window-frame,
and felt as if he were floating
away on the buoyant fragrance&mdash;far, far
away, to the South, where his home was, and
where the roses were in bloom so long that
it seemed as if there were always roses.</p>

<p>The silver-lit garden vanished from his
sight, and he saw instead a long, low room,
half garret, half workshop, where a man
stood beside a long table, busily at work with
some fine tools. The spare, stooping figure,
the long, delicate hands, the features carved
as if in ivory, the blue, near-sighted
eyes peering anxiously at the work in his
hands,&mdash;all these were as actually present to
the boy as if he could put out his own hand
and touch them. It was with a start that he
came back to the world of tangible surroundings,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
as a sudden breath of wind waved the
trees below him, and sent whisperings of leaf
and blossom through his room.</p>

<p>"Daddy!" he said half to himself; and
he brushed away something which had no
possible place in the eyes of a youth who was
to go to college next year. Giving himself
a violent shake, Jack Ferrers rose, and, going
to a cupboard, took out with great care a
long, black, oblong box. This he deposited
on the bed; then took off his boots and put
on a pair of soft felt slippers. His coat, too,
was taken off; and then, holding the black
box in his arms, as if it were a particularly
delicate baby, he left the room, and softly
made his way to the stairs which led to the
attic. There was a door at the foot of the
stairs, which he opened noiselessly, and then
he stopped to listen. All was still. He
must have been sitting for some time at the
window, for the light in the hall was extinguished,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
which was a sign that his uncle had
gone to bed. In fact, as he listened intently,
his ear caught a faint, rhythmic sound, rising
and falling at regular intervals, like the distant
murmur of surf on the sea-shore; his
uncle was asleep. Closing the door softly
after him, and clasping the black box firmly,
Jack climbed the attic stairs and disappeared
in the darkness.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>COUSIN JACK.</div>

<div class="figright" style="width: 339px;"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121"></a>
<img src="images/gs03.png" width="339" height="500" alt="&quot;Jack Ferrers appeared carrying a Huge Bunch of Roses.&quot;" title="" />
<span class="caption">&quot;<span class="smcap">Jack Ferrers appeared carrying a Huge Bunch of Roses.</span>&quot;</span>
</div>
<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">The</span> next day, as Hildegarde was arranging
flowers on the piazza, with a table before
her covered with bowls and vases, and a
great basket of many-coloured blossoms beside
her, Jack Ferrers appeared, evidently in the
depths of misery, carrying a huge bunch of
roses. He stumbled while coming up the
steps, and dropped half the roses, which increased
his discomfort so much that Hildegarde
was really sorry for him. Moreover,
when seen by daylight, he was a very pleasant-looking
fellow, with curly brown hair and
great honest blue eyes very wide open. He
was over six feet tall, and as awkward as a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
human being could be, but of course he could
not help that.</div>



<p>"Good-morning, Cousin Jack!" said Hildegarde
pleasantly. "What lovely roses! Are
they from Colonel Ferrers's garden?"</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Jack Ferrers. "Uncle sends
them with his compliments. I'm sorry I
knocked over the basket last night. Good-by."</p>

<p>He was about to fling himself down the
steps again, but Hildegarde, controlling her
desire to laugh, said cordially: "Oh, don't go!
Sit down a moment, and tell me the names
of some of these beauties."</p>

<p>"Thank you!" muttered the youth, blushing
redder than the roses. "I&mdash;I think I
must go back."</p>

<p>"Are you so very busy?" asked Hildegarde
innocently. "I thought this was your
vacation. What have you to do?"</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;nothing!" said the lad awkwardly.
"Nothing in particular."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span></p>

<p>"Then sit down," said Hildegarde decidedly.</p>

<p>And Jack Ferrers sat down. A pause followed.
Then Hildegarde said in a matter-of-fact
tone, "You have no sisters, have you,
Cousin Jack?"</p>

<p>"No," was the reply. "How did you
know?"</p>

<p>"Because you are so shy," said Hildegarde,
smiling. "Boys who have no sisters are
apt to regard girls as a kind of griffin.
There used to be a boy at dancing-school,
two or three years ago, who was so shy it
was really painful to dance with him at first,
but he got over it after a while. And it was
all because he had no sisters."</p>

<p>"Did you like dancing-school?" Jack inquired,
venturing to look up at her shyly.</p>

<p>"Yes, very much indeed!" replied Hildegarde.
"Didn't you?"</p>

<p>"No; hated it."</p>

<p>Then they both laughed a little, and after<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
that things went a good deal better. Jack
came up on the piazza (he had been sitting
on the steps, shuffling his feet in a most distressing
manner), and helped to clip the
long stems of the roses, and pulled off superfluous
leaves. It appeared that he did not
care much for flowers, though he admitted
that roses were "pretty." He did not care
for fishing or shooting; tennis had made his
head ache ever since he began to grow so
fast. Did he like walking? Pretty well,
when it wasn't too hot. Reading? Well
enough, when the book wasn't stupid.</p>

<p>"Wot are we to do with this 'ere 'opeless
chap?" said Hildegarde to herself, quoting
from "Pinafore."</p>

<p>As a last resort she asked if he were fond
of music. Instantly his face lighted up.</p>

<p>"Awfully fond of it," he said with animation,
and the embarrassed wrinkle disappeared
as if by magic from between his eyebrows.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, I am so glad!" cried Hildegarde.
"I haven't had any music the last two summers.
I had everything else that was nice,
but still I missed it, of course. Do you play,
or sing?"</p>

<p>"A little of both," said Jack modestly.</p>

<p>"Oh, how delightful! We must make
music together for mamma sometimes. My
own piano has not come yet, but there is
the dearest old funny thing here which belonged
to the Misses Aytoun."</p>

<p>"Uncle Tom has no piano," said Jack,
"but I have my violin, so I don't mind."</p>

<p>"Oh, a violin!" said Hildegarde, opening
her eyes wide. "Have you been studying
it long?"</p>

<p>"Ever since I was six years old," was the
reply. "My mother would not let me begin
earlier, though my father said that as
soon as I could hold a knife and fork I could
hold a bow. He's a little cracked about<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
violins, my father. He makes them, you
know."</p>

<p>"I <i>don't</i> know," cried Hildegarde. "Tell
me about it; how very interesting!"</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;I don't mean that it's his business,"
said Jack, who seemed to have forgotten
his shyness entirely; "he's a lawyer, you
know. But it's the only thing he really
cares about. He has a workshop, and he
has made&mdash;oh, ever so many violins! He
went to Cremona once, and spent a year
there, poking about, and he found an old
church that was going to be repaired, and
bought the sounding-board. Oh, it must
have been a couple of hundred years old.
Then he moused about more and found an
old fellow, a descendant of one of Amati's
workmen, and I believe he would have
bought him, too, if he could; but, anyhow,
they were great chums, and he taught my
father all kinds of tricks. When he came<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
home he made this violin out of a piece of
the old sounding-board, and gave it to me
on my birthday. It's&mdash;oh, it's no end, you
know! And he made another for himself,
and we play together. Do you know the
Mozart Concerto in F, for two violins? It
begins with an allegro."</p>

<p>And being fairly mounted on his hobby,
Jack Ferrers pranced about on it as if he had
done nothing but talk to Hildegarde all his
life. Hildegarde, meanwhile, listened with a
mixture of surprise, amusement, and respect.
He did not look in the least like a musical
genius, this long-legged, curly-haired lad, with
his blue eyes and his simple, honest face.
She thought of the lion front of Beethoven,
and the brilliant, exquisite beauty of Mozart,
and tried to imagine honest Jack standing
between them, and almost laughed in the
midst of an animated description of the andante
movement. Then she realised that he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
was talking extremely well, and talking a
great deal over her head.</p>

<p>"I am afraid you will find me very ignorant,"
she said meekly, when her cousin
paused, a little out of breath, but with glowing
cheeks and sparkling eyes. "I have
heard a great deal of music, of course, and
I love it dearly; but I don't know about it
as you do, not a bit. I play the piano a
little, and I sing, just simple old songs, you
know, and that is all."</p>

<p>Hildegarde might have added that she had
a remarkably sweet voice, and sang with taste
and feeling, but that her cousin must find out
for himself; besides, she was really over-awed
by this superior knowledge in one whom the
night before she had been inclined to set
down as a booby. "Shall I ever learn," she
thought remorsefully, "not to make these
ridiculous judgments of people, before I know
anything about them?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span></p>

<p>Just then Mrs. Grahame came out and
asked her new-found nephew, as she called
him, to stay to dinner; but at sight of her
the lad's shyness returned in full force. His
animation died away; he hung his head, and
muttered that he "couldn't possibly, thank
you! Uncle Tom&mdash;stayed too long already.
Good-by!" and, without even a farewell glance
at Hildegarde, went down all the steps at
once with a breakneck plunge, and disappeared.</p>

<p>"Tragedy of the Gorgon's Head! Medusa,
Mrs. Grahame," said that lady, laughing
softly. "Has my hair turned to snakes,
Hilda, or what is there so frightful in my
appearance? I heard your voices sounding
so merrily I thought the ice was completely
broken."</p>

<p>"Oh, I think it is," said Hildegarde. "You
came upon him suddenly, that was all."</p>

<p>"Next time," said her mother, "I will<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
appear gradually, like the Cheshire Cat, beginning
with the grin."</p>

<p>Hildegarde laughed, and went to pin a red
rose on her mother's dress. Then she said:
"I was wrong, Mammina, and you were right,
as usual. It is a tiresome way you have, so
monotonous! But really he is a very nice
boy, and he knows, oh! ever so much about
music. He must be quite a wonder." And
she told her mother about the violin, and all
the rest of it.</p>

<p>Mrs. Grahame agreed with her that it
would be delightful to have some musical
evenings, and Hildegarde resolved to practise
two hours a day regularly.</p>

<p>"But there are so few hours in the day!"
she complained. "I thought getting up at
seven would give me&mdash;oh! ever so much
time, and I have none at all. Here is the
morning nearly gone, and we have had no
reading, not a word." And she looked injured.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span></p>

<p>"There is an hour before dinner," said Mrs.
Grahame, "and the 'Makers of Florence' is
lying on my table at this minute. Come up,
and I will read while you&mdash;need I specify
the occupation?"</p>

<p>"You need not," said Hildegarde. "I
really did mean to mend it this morning,
love, but things happened. I had to sew on
boot-buttons before breakfast, three of them,
and then Janet wanted me to show her about
something. But now I will really be industrious."</p>

<p>This was destined to be a day of visits. In
the afternoon Mrs. Loftus and her daughter
called, driving up in great state, with prancing
horses and clinking harness. Hildegarde,
who was in her own room, meditated
a plunge down her private staircase and an
escape by way of the back door, but decided
that it would be base to desert her mother;
so she smoothed her waving hair, inspected<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
her gown to make sure that it was spotless,
and came down into the parlour.</p>

<p>Mrs. Loftus was a very large lady, with a
very red face, who talked volubly about "our
place," "our horses," "our hot-houses," etc.,
etc. Miss Loftus, whose name was Leonie,
was small and rather pretty, though she did
not look altogether amiable. She was inclined
to patronise Hildegarde, but that
young person did not take kindly to patronage,
and was a little stately, though very polite,
in her manner.</p>

<p>"Yes, it is pretty about here," said Miss
Loftus, "though one tires of it very quickly.
We vegetate here for three months every
summer; it's papa's" (she pronounced it
"puppa") "whim, you see. How long a
season do you make?"</p>

<p>"None at all," said Hildegarde quietly.
"We are going to live here."</p>

<p>Miss Loftus raised her eyebrows. "Oh! you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
can hardly do that, I should think!" she said
with a superior smile. "A few months will
probably change your views entirely. There
is no life here, absolutely none."</p>

<p>"Indeed!" said Hildegarde. "I thought
it was a very prosperous neighbourhood.
All the farms look thrifty and well cared
for; the crops are alive, at least."</p>

<p>"Oh, farmers and crops!" said Miss Loftus.
"Very likely. I meant social life."</p>

<p>"I don't like social life," said Hildegarde.</p>

<p>This was not strictly true, but she could
not help saying it, as she told her mother
afterward.</p>

<p>Miss Loftus passed over the remark with
another smile, which made our heroine want
to pinch her, and added, "You must consider
us your only neighbours, as indeed we really
are."</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed!" said Mrs. Loftus, who was
now rising ponderously to depart. "We<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
shall hope to see you often at The Poplars,
Mrs. Grahame. There is not another house
within five miles where one can visit. Of
course I don't include that old bear, Colonel
Ferrers, who never speaks a civil word to any
one."</p>

<p>Hildegarde flushed and looked at her
mother, but Mrs. Grahame said very quietly,
"I have known Colonel Ferrers for many
years. He was a friend of my husband's."</p>

<p>"Oh, I beg your pardon!" said Mrs. Loftus,
looking scared. "I had no idea&mdash;I
never heard of <i>any one</i> knowing Colonel Ferrers.
Come, Leonie, we must be going."</p>

<p>They departed, first engaging Hildegarde,
rather against her will, to lunch with them
the following Friday; and the grand equipage
rolled clinking and jingling away.</p>

<p>"We seem to have fallen upon a Montague
and Capulet neighbourhood," said Mrs. Grahame,
smiling, as she turned to go upstairs.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, indeed!" said Hildegarde. "Shall
we be Tybalts or Mercutios?"</p>

<p>"Neither, I hope," said her mother, "as
both were run through the body. Of course,
however, there is no question as to which
neighbour we shall find most congenial.
And now, child, get your hat, and let us
take a good walk, to drive the cobwebs out
of our brains."</p>

<p>"Have with you!" said Hildegarde, running
lightly up the stairs; "only, darling,
<i>don't</i> be so&mdash;so&mdash;incongruous as to call
Mrs. Loftus a cobweb!"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>MISS AGATHA'S CABINET.</div>


<div class='unindent'>"<span class="smcap">Mammina!</span> I have found them! I have
found them!" cried Hildegarde, rushing like
a whirlwind into her mother's room, and
waving something over her head.</div>

<p>"What have you found, darling?" asked
Mrs. Grahame, looking up from her writing.
"Not your wits, for example? I should be
so glad!"</p>

<p>"One may not shake one's mother," said
Hildegarde, "but beware, lest you 'rouse an
Indian's indomitable nature.' I have found
the keys of Miss Agatha's cabinet."</p>

<p>"Really!" cried Mrs. Grahame, laying<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
down her pen. "Are you sure? where were
they?"</p>

<p>"In that old secretary in Uncle Aytoun's
room," said Hildegarde. "You know you
said I might rummage in it some day, and
this rainy afternoon seemed to be the very
time. They were in a little drawer, all by
themselves; and see, they are marked, 'Keys
of the cabinet in my sister Agatha's room,
containing miniatures, etc.'"</p>

<p>"This is indeed a discovery!" said Mrs.
Grahame, rising. "We will examine the
cabinet together, dear; as you say, it is just
the day for it."</p>

<p>Hildegarde led the way, dancing with excitement
and pleasure; her mother followed
more slowly. There might be sadness, she
thought, as well as pleasure, in looking over
the relics of a family which had died out,
leaving none of the name, so far as she knew,
in this country at least. Miss Agatha's room<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
did not look very cheerful in the grey light
of a wet day. The prevailing tint of walls
and ceiling was a greyish yellow; the faded
curtains were held back by faded ribbons;
the furniture was angular and high-shouldered.
On the wall was a coloured print of
"London in 1802," from which the metropolis
would seem to have been a singular place.
The only interesting feature in the room was
the cabinet which they had come to explore,
and this was really a beautiful piece of furniture.
It stood seven feet high at least, and
was apparently of solid ebony, inlaid with
yellow ivory in curious spiral patterns. In
the centre was a small door, almost entirely
covered with the ivory tracery; above, below,
and around were drawers, large and small,
deep and shallow, a very wilderness of
drawers. All had silver keyholes of curious
pattern, and all were fast locked, a fact
which had seriously interfered with Hildegarde's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
peace of mind ever since they came
to the house. Now, however, that she actually
stood before it with the "Open
sesame," this bunch of quaint silver keys
in her hand, she shrank back, and felt shy
and afraid.</p>

<p>"You must open it, mamma," she said.
"I dare not."</p>

<p>Mrs. Grahame fitted a key to one of the
larger drawers, and opened it. A faint perfume
floated out, old roses and lavender, laid
away one knows not how many years. Under
folds of silver paper lay some damask towels,
fine and thick and smooth, but yellow with
age. They were tied with a lilac ribbon, and
on the ribbon was pinned a piece of paper,
covered with writing in a fine, cramped hand.</p>

<p>"Lift them out carefully, dear," said Mrs.
Grahame, "and read the label."</p>

<p>Hildegarde complied, and read aloud:
"These towels were spun and woven by my<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
grandmother Grahame in Scotland, before she
came to this country. Her maiden name was
Annot McIntosh."</p>

<p>"What beautiful linen!" said Mrs. Grahame,
smoothing the glossy folds with the
hand of a housewife. "I always wished I
had learned to spin and weave. Linen that
one buys has no feeling in it. Lay it back
reverently, degenerate daughter of the nineteenth
century, and your degenerate mother
will open another drawer."</p>

<p>The next drawer contained several sets of
baby-clothes, at sight of which Hildegarde
opened her eyes very wide indeed. Her
mother was an exquisite needle-woman, so
was her cousin Wealthy Bond, and she herself
had no need to be ashamed of the "fine
seam" she could sew; but never had she
seen such needlework as this: tiny caps,
wrought so thick with flower and leaf that
no spot of the plain linen could be seen;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
robes of finest lawn, with wonderful embroidered
fronts; shawls of silk flannel,
with deep borders of heavy "laid work."
One robe was so beautiful that both Hildegarde
and her mother cried over it, and took
it up to examine it more carefully. On the
breast was pinned a piece of paper, with an
inscription in the same delicate hand: "Hester's
christening-robe. We think it was in
consequence of this fine work that our dear
mother lost her eyesight."</p>

<p>"I should think it highly probable," said
Mrs. Grahame, laying the exquisite monument
of folly back in the drawer. "I did not know
that old Madam Aytoun was blind. What
is written on that tiny cap, in the corner
there? It must be a doll's cap; no baby
could be so small."</p>

<p>Hildegarde read the inscription: "Worn
by our uncle Hesketh, who weighed two
pounds at birth. He grew to be six feet and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
six inches in height, and weighed three hundred
pounds."</p>

<p>"What a wonderful person Miss Agatha
must have been!" said Hildegarde. "Who
else would think of all these pleasant bits of
information? And now for the next
drawer!"</p>

<p>She opened it, and gave a little shriek of
delight. Here truly were beautiful things,
such as neither she nor her mother had ever
seen before: three short aprons of white
silk, trimmed with deep gold lace, and covered
with silk-embroidered flowers of richest
hues, one with tulips, another with roses, a
third with carnations. Folds of tissue paper
separated them from each other, and the
legend told that they had been worn by "our
great-grandmother Ponsonby, when she was
Maid of Honour to Queen Caroline. She was
an Englishwoman."</p>

<p>Then came a tippet of white marabou<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
feathers, buttoned into a silk case, and smelling
faintly of camphor; a gown of rose-coloured
satin, brocaded with green, and one of
ruby-coloured velvet, which bore the inscription:
"This was the gown on which our great-grandmother
Ponsonby wore the diamond buttons
which have since been divided among
her descendants. A sinful waste of money
which might have been put to good purpose."</p>

<p>"How <i>very</i> frivolous Great-grandmother
Ponsonby must have been!" said Hildegarde.
"I think Miss Agatha is rather hard on her,
though. Perhaps the buttons were wedding
presents. I wonder what has become of them
all! See, Mammina, here are her red shoes&mdash;just
like Beatrix Esmond's, aren't they? My
foot would not begin to go into them. And
here&mdash;oh! the lace! the lace!" For there
was a whole drawer full of lace, all in little
bundles neatly tied up and marked. Here
was Madam Aytoun's wedding veil, Grandmother<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
This One's Mechlin tabs, Aunt That
One's Venetian flounces. It would take pages
to describe all the laces, and the pleasure
that mother and daughter had in examining
them. What woman or girl does not
love lace? Finally, in a corner of the drawer,
was a morocco box containing a key, whose
ivory label said: "Central compartment.
Miniatures."</p>

<p>"This will be the best of all!" cried Hildegarde,
eagerly. "Perhaps we shall find
Great-grandmother Ponsonby herself. Who
knows?"</p>

<p>The ivory door flew open as the key
turned, and revealed a space set round with
tiny drawers. Each drawer contained one or
more miniatures, in cases of red or green
morocco, and Hildegarde and her mother
examined them with delight. Here, to be
sure, was Great-grandmother Ponsonby; in
fact, she appeared twice: first, as a splendid<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
young matron, clad in the identical ruby
velvet with the diamond buttons, her hair
powdered high and adorned with feathers;
and, again, as a not less superb old lady, with
folds of snowy muslin under her chin, and
keen dark eyes flashing from under her white
curls, and a wonderful cap. Here was Grandfather
Aytoun, first as a handsome boy, with
great dark eyes, and a parrot on his hand,
then as a somewhat choleric-looking gentleman
with a great fur collar.</p>

<p>"How they do change!" said Hildegarde.
"I am not sure that I like to see two of the
same person. Let me see, now! He married&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The daughter of Great-grandmother Ponsonby,"
replied Mrs. Grahame. "Here she is!
Caroline Regina Ponsonby, <i>&aelig;t.</i> 16. Named
after the royal patroness, you see. What a
sweet, gentle-looking girl! I fear her magnificent
mother and her decided-looking husband<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
may have been too much for her, for I
see she died at twenty-three."</p>

<p>"Oh! and he married again!" cried Hildegarde,
opening another case. "See here!
Selina Euphemia McKenzie, second wife of
John Aytoun. Oh! and here is a slip of
paper inside the frame.</p>

<div class='poem'>
"'Sweet flower, that faded soon<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">In Rapture's fervid noon.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 12.5em;">'J. A.'</span><br />
</div>

<p>"Dear me! he must have written it himself!"
she added. "It is not like Miss Agatha's
handwriting. Why, she only lived three
months, poor dear! He makes very sure
about the rapture, doesn't he?"</p>

<p>"I think he does," said her mother, smiling,
"considering that he married a third
time, inside a year from the fading of the
sweet flower. Look at this aquiline dame,
with the remarkably firm mouth, and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
bird of paradise in her turban. 'Adelaide
McLeod, third wife of John Aytoun. She
survived him.' I'll warrant she did!" said
Mrs. Grahame. "She carries conquest in her
face. All the children were of the first marriage,
and I fear she was not a gentle stepmother.
I wonder who this may be!" She
took up a heavy bracelet of dark hair, with a
small miniature set in the clasp. "What a
pretty, pretty child! Good Miss Agatha has
surely not left us in the dark concerning him.
'Little John Hesketh, 1804.' That is all."</p>

<p>"Why Hesketh?" asked Hildegarde. "I
have never heard of any Heskeths."</p>

<p>Mrs. Grahame was about to plunge into
genealogical depths, when Hildegarde, who
had been opening a case of purple morocco,
carefully secured with silver clasps, gave an
exclamation of pleasure.</p>

<p>"Hester!" she cried. "This is Hester, I
know."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span></p>

<p>Her mother looked, and nodded; and they
both gazed in silence at the lovely face, with
its earnest grey eyes.</p>

<p>"The dear!" murmured Hildegarde. "How
I should have loved her! I am sure we should
have liked the same things. I wish she had
not died."</p>

<p>"You must remember that she would be a
dear old lady now, were she alive, and not a
young lassie. What does the slip say, darling?
Miss Agatha's hand is rather trying
for my eyes."</p>

<p>"'Our dearest Hester,'" Hildegarde read.
"'A duplicate of the one painted for Robert
Ferrers.' Robert Ferrers!" she repeated
thoughtfully. "Is that Colonel Ferrers? and
do you suppose&mdash;"</p>

<p>At this moment came a knock at the door,
and Janet informed them that Mrs. Lankton
was in the hall, and would like to speak to
one of the ladies.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span></p>

<p>"I will go," said Hildegarde, laying down
the miniature reluctantly.</p>

<p>"We will both go," said her mother. "The
poor old dame! We have neglected her all
these days."</p>

<p>They locked the drawer of the treasure-cabinet,
and Hildegarde ran to put the precious
keys in a safe place, while her mother
went directly downstairs. By the time Hildegarde
appeared, Mrs. Lankton was launched
on the full tide of her woes, and was sailing
along with a good breeze.</p>

<p>"And it's comin' in, Mis' Grahame&mdash;I'd
say like a house afire, if 'twa'n't that 'twas
wet. Dreepin' all down the chimbley, and
runnin' over the floor in streams. I stepped
into a pool o' water with my bar' feet, gittin'
out o' bed; likely I caught my death, but it's
no great matter. Ah! Mis' Grahame, I've
seen trouble all my life. Mr. Aytoun, he
was like a father to me. He wouldn't never<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
ha' let me go bar'foot in water if he'd ben
alive. I've ben a hard-workin' woman all
my life, and he knowed it. I hope your own
health is good, dear?"</p>

<p>"What can I do for you, Mrs. Lankton?"
asked Mrs. Grahame, kindly, as a moment's
pause gave her a chance to get in a word.
"Does the roof need shingling?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Aytoun was goin' to have it shingled
for me last Janooary," said Mrs. Lankton,
with a sigh that was almost a groan; "and
he was called on to die in Febooary. Jest
afore he passed away, he was tryin' dretful
hard to say somethin', and I ain't no manner
o' doubt myself but what 'twas 'Shingle!'
He had it on his mind; they needn't tell me.
But nobody seemed to feel a call after he
was gone. Ah, dear me! You don't know
nothin' about it, Mis' Grahame. You ain't
never stepped bar'foot out o' your bed into a
pool o' water, and you all doubled up with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
neurology in your j'ints. Ah, well, 'twon't
be long now that I shall trouble anybody."</p>

<p>"Which is your house, Mrs. Lankton?"
asked Mrs. Grahame. "I will try to have
something done about the roof at once."</p>

<p>"I know!" said Hildegarde, quickly. "It
is a brown cottage with a green door."</p>

<p>"See how she knows!" exclaimed Mrs.
Lankton, with a sad smile. "Ain't that
thoughtful? Ah! she'll be a comfit to you,
Mis' Grahame, if you've luck to raise her, but
there's no knowin'. Don't you set your
heart on it, that's all. Ah! I know what
trouble is."</p>

<p>"Don't you think I am 'raised' already,
Mrs. Lankton?" Hilda asked, smiling down
on the weazened face that did not reach to
her shoulder.</p>

<p>"So fur ye be, dear!" replied the widow,
with a doleful shake of the head. "So fur
ye be, but there's no knowin'. My Phrony<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
was jest like you, hearty and stout, and she's
gone. Ah! dear me! She had a store tooth,
where she knocked out one of hers, slidin',
and she swallered it one night, and she
never got over it. Lodged on her liver, the
doctor said. He went down and tried to
fetch it up, but 'twa'n't no use. She was
fleshy, same as you be. Yes, gals is hard to
raise."</p>

<p>At this, Hildegarde retreated suddenly into
the parlour, and Mrs. Grahame, in a voice
which shook a little, expressed proper regret
and sympathy, and repeated that she would
have the roof attended to.</p>

<p>"And now," she added, "go into the
kitchen, and auntie shall give you a cup of
hot tea. You must dry your feet, too, before
you go out again."</p>

<p>"The Lord'll reward you, dear!" said
Mrs. Lankton, turning with a faint gleam of
cheerfulness toward the kitchen door. "It<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
ain't long before I shall go the way of
all, but it doos seem as if I mought go dry,
'stead o' dreepin'. But <i>you</i>'ll be rewarded,
Mis' Grahame. I felt as if you'd be a mother
to me, soon as I sot eyes on ye. <i>Good</i>-mornin',
dear!" and with a groan that ended
in a half-chuckle, she disappeared.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE POPLARS.</div>


<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">Punctually</span> at half-past one on Friday,
Hildegarde walked up the avenue which led
to "The Poplars." It was a broad avenue,
and the steps to which it led were broad, and
the whole house had an air of being spread
out. "But Mrs. Loftus needs a good deal of
room!" said Hildegarde to herself, and then
cuffed herself mentally for wickedness.</div>

<p>Very fair and sweet she looked, our Hildegarde,
in her white serge gown, with the
pretty hat of white "chiffon" which "Mammina"
had made only the evening before.
Standing on the verandah, with eyes and
cheeks brilliant from walking, she met the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
entire approval of a young gentleman who
was reclining behind the hedge. He was a
<i>very</i> young gentleman. He wore corduroy
knickerbockers, and he was lying flat on his
stomach, with his heels in the air, sucking a
large bull's-eye. The sudden apparition of
a tall maiden in white, with shining eyes,
nearly caused him to swallow the bull's-eye,
but he recovered himself, and gazed steadfastly
at her. When the door opened to
admit her, the young gentleman sighed, and
considered that it was not so fine a day as he
had thought it. "She is a beautiful girl!"
he said to himself with fervour; "she is a
Purple Maid!" and then he rolled over on
his back, to see if the bull's-eye would taste as
good in that position.</p>

<p>Hildegarde, meanwhile, unconscious of the
approving scrutiny of the infant connoisseur,
was ushered by a stately butler through room
after room, until she came to one where Mrs.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
and Miss Loftus were waiting to receive her.
They were both very cordial, one in a ponderous,
the other in an airily patronising way.</p>

<p>"But I did not hear you drive up," said
Mrs. Loftus, "and we have been listening
every moment; for I said to Leonie, 'Suppose
she should not come, after all!' And so
you must have driven up very quietly, you
see."</p>

<p>"I walked," said Hildegarde, smiling; "so
there were no wheels to hear, Mrs. Loftus."</p>

<p>"Walked! Is it possible?" cried Mrs.
Loftus, while her daughter raised her eyebrows
and regarded Hildegarde with languid
curiosity. "My dear, you must be terribly
heated. Let me ring for some Florida water.
No, I insist!" as Hildegarde made a gesture
of protest. "It is <i>so</i> dangerous to walk in
the heat of the day. The brain, you know,
becomes heated, and it does something to the
spinal marrow. Do you feel any dizziness?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
Really, the best thing would be for you to lie
down at once for half an hour. I will darken
the room, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Nonsense, mamma!" said Miss Loftus,
"I don't believe Miss Grahame wants to lie
down."</p>

<p>"Oh, no, indeed!" cried Hildegarde, thankful
for the interruption. "I am used to walking,
you know, Mrs. Loftus. I always walk,
everywhere. I like it very much better than
driving; besides," she added, "we have no
horses, so I should have to walk in any case."</p>

<p>"I think it so dangerous!" said Mrs.
Loftus, with a compassionate shake of the
head. "In the heat of the day, as I said,
the spinal marrow; so important, my dear!
and towards evening there is a chill in the
air, malaria, all kinds of dreadful things. I
shall make a point of picking you up whenever
I am driving by&mdash;I drive by nearly
every day&mdash;and taking you out."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;thank you!" cried poor Hildegarde,
an abyss opening at her feet. "You
are very kind, but I could not! I am so busy&mdash;and
walking is my delight."</p>

<p>The announcement of lunch created a diversion,
to the great relief of our heroine.
Mr. Loftus appeared, a small, shrivelled man,
with sharp eyes, whose idea of making himself
agreeable was to criticise each article of
food as it came on the table.</p>

<p>"Very weak bouillon, Mrs. Loftus" (he
called it "bullion"). "Very weak! greasy,
too! Not fit to put on the table. What's
this? chicken? Fowl, I should say! Rooster,
Mrs. L.! Is this your twelve-dollar cook?
Not a thing Miss Grahame can eat! She'll
go and tell old Ferrers how we gave her roast
rooster, see if she don't! I hear you're very
thick with old Ferrers, Miss Grahame. Old
Grizzly Bruin, <i>I</i> call him. Good name, too!
he! he!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span></p>

<p>Hildegarde blushed scarlet, and wondered
what her mother would say in her place. All
she could do was to murmur that the chicken
was very nice indeed, and to hope that she
did not show more of her disgust than was
proper. The luncheon was very fine, in spite
of Mr. Loftus's depreciation; and when it came
to the dessert, he changed his tune, and
descanted on the qualities of "my peaches,"
"my nectarines," and "my gardener."</p>

<p>"You don't eat enough, Miss Grahame!"
was his comment. "No need to stint yourself
here; plenty for all, and more where
that came from."</p>

<p>But here Miss Loftus came to the rescue,
and with a "Don't be tiresome, puppa!"
changed the conversation, and began to talk
of the Worth gowns she had seen in New
York, on her last visit.</p>

<p>"Which do you admire most, Worth or
Felix?" she asked, after a graphic description<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
of some marvellous gown which fitted
the fortunate owner "as if she had been
poured into it. Absolutely <i>poured</i>, Miss
Grahame!"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I really don't know," Hildegarde confessed
meekly. "I never can tell one dressmaker's
style from another. If a gown is
pretty, that is all I think about it."</p>

<p>"Oh! if you have never studied these
things, of course!" said the fair Leonie
indulgently. "I went to Madame Vivien's
school, you see, and we had a regular hour
for studying fashions. I can tell a Worth
or a Felix or a Donovan gown as far as I
can see it."</p>

<p>"Did you like Madame Vivien's school?"
asked Hildegarde.</p>

<p>"She ought to!" exclaimed Mr. Loftus.
"It cost enough, I can tell you."</p>

<p>"Oh, it is the best school in the city, of
course," said Leonie complacently. "We had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
a very good time, a set of us that were there.
They called us the Highflyers, and I suppose
we had rather top-lofty notions. Anyway,
we were Madame's favourites, because we had
<i>the air</i>, she always said. She couldn't endure
a dowdy girl, and she dressed beautifully herself.
There were two or three girls that were
regular digs, with their noses always in their
books, and Madame couldn't bear them.
'Miss Antrim,' she was always saving to one
of them, 'it is true that you know your lesson,
but your gown is buttoned awry, and
it fits as if the miller had made it.' He!
he!"</p>

<p>"And&mdash;and did you care for study?"
Hildegarde asked, mentally sympathising
with Miss Antrim, though conscious that she
would never have been allowed to go to
school with a gown buttoned awry.</p>

<p>"Oh! I liked French," said Miss Loftus,
"and history pretty well, when it wasn't too<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
poky. But you didn't have to study at
Madame Vivien's unless you wanted to."</p>

<p>"What Leonie went most for was manners,"
explained Mrs. Loftus, taking a large
mouthful of mayonnaise, and continuing her
remarks while eating it. "Elegant manners
they teach at Madame Vivien's."</p>

<p>"How to enter a room well,"&mdash;Leonie enumerated
the points on her taper fingers,&mdash;"how
to salute and take leave of a hostess,
how to order a dinner,&mdash;those were some of
the most important things. We took turns
in making up <i>menus</i>, and prizes were given
for the best."</p>

<p>"Leonie took the prize for the best minew!"
exclaimed Mrs. Loftus, triumphantly. "Tell
Miss Grahame your prize minew, Leonie."</p>

<p>Nothing loth, Leonie described the dinner
at length, from little-neck clams to coffee;
and a very fine dinner it was.</p>

<p>"Hm!" grunted Mr. Loftus, "better dinner<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
than we ever get from your twelve-dollar
cook, Mrs. L. Hm! Fine dinners on paper,
I dare say. Hand me that salad! Why don't
you give Miss Grahame some more salad?
She ain't eating anything at all."</p>

<p>"Then we had lectures on the Art of
Dress," continued the fair student of Madame
Vivien's. "Those were very interesting."</p>

<p>"Well, dress does change, the most of anything!"
exclaimed Mrs. Loftus. "To see
the difference now from when I was a girl!
Why, when I was married I had thirty-five
yards of silk in my wedding dress, and now
nobody don't have more than ten or twelve.
Almost too scant to cover 'em, it seems sometimes."</p>

<p>"Thirty-five yards, mamma!" exclaimed
her daughter. "You're joking!"</p>

<p>"Not a mite!" Mrs. Loftus said firmly.
"Thirty-five yards of white satin, and trimmed
with four whole pieces of lace and three hundred<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
and eighty-two bows." The two girls
exclaimed in wonder, and Mrs. Loftus continued
in high good-humour. "Yes, a dress
was a dress in those days. Why, I had one
walking dress, a brown silk it was, with fifty
yards in it."</p>

<p>"But how was it possible?" cried Hildegarde.
"Did you wear crinoline?"</p>

<p>"No," was the reply, "not a mite of hoop-skirt;
but things were very full, you see,
Miss Grahame. That brown dress, now; it
had a deep side-plaiting all round, and an
overskirt, very full too, and the back very
deep, flounced, scalloped, and trimmed with
narrow piping, looped in each corner with
scallops. There was a deep fringe round the
basque and overskirt, and coming up from
the postilion (that was deep, too), to loop on
the left shoulder."</p>

<p>"Well, it sounds <i>awful!</i>" said Leonie<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
frankly. "You must have been a perfect
sight, mamma!"</p>

<p>"She was better-looking than you are, or
ever will be!" snarled Mr. Loftus. "Are you
goin' to sit here all day talkin' about women's
folderols? I have to pay for 'em, and I guess
that's all I want to know about 'em."</p>

<p>Glad enough was Hildegarde when four
o'clock came, and she could plead an appointment
to meet her mother at a certain turn
of the road, as they were going for a walk
together.</p>

<p>"More walking!" cried Mrs. Loftus. "You'll
have a fever, I'm certain of it. I don't think
girls ought <i>ever</i> to walk, unless it's a little
turn in the park while the horses are waiting,
or something of that sort." She begged
Hildegarde to wait till the horses were harnessed,
but our heroine was firm, and finally
departed, leaving her good-natured hostess<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
shaking her head in the doorway, like a mandarin
in wine-coloured satin.</p>

<p>As she turned the corner by the gilded iron
gates, Hildegarde was startled by the apparition
of a small boy in brown corduroy, sitting
on a post and swinging his legs.</p>

<p>Hildegarde was fond of boys. One of her
two best friends was a boy, and she had a
little sweetheart in Maine, whose name was
Benny, and who loved her with all the ardour
of four years old. This boy must be six or
seven, she thought. He had red hair, a
round, rosy, freckled face, and two eyes so
blue and so bright that the very meeting
them made her smile. Her smile was answered
by a flash, which lighted up the whole
face, and subsided instantly, leaving preternatural
gravity.</p>

<p>"How do you do?" said Hildegarde. "Is
it fun sitting there?"</p>

<p>"No!" said the boy; and down he came.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
Then shyness seized him; he hung his head
and considered his toes attentively.</p>

<p>"My name is Hilda," continued our heroine.
"Do you think it is a nice name?"</p>

<p>He nodded, still intent on the boots.</p>

<p>"But I don't know what your name is,"
she went on sadly. "I should like to tell
you about my puppy, if you would walk along
by me, but you see I can't, because I don't
know your name."</p>

<p>"Hugh Allen," said the lad briefly.</p>

<p>"Hugh!" cried Hildegarde, her cheek
flushing and her eyes softening. "That was
my dear father's name. We must be friends,
Hugh, for the name's sake. Come along,
laddie!"</p>

<p>The boy came, and walked in silence by
her side, occasionally stealing a glance at the
kind, bright face so much higher up than his
own.</p>

<p>"Well, my puppy," said Hildegarde, as if<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
she were continuing a conversation. "His
name was Patsy, and he was such a funny
puppy,&mdash;all white, with a great big head,
and paws almost as big, and a mouth large
enough to swallow&mdash;oh! I don't know what!
a watermelon, perhaps. I loved him very
much. He used to gnaw my boots, and nibble
the skirt of my dress; but, of course, I didn't
mind, for I knew he was cutting his teeth,
poor dear, and couldn't help it. But when he
gnawed all the corners off the leather chairs
in the dining-room, my mother dear didn't
like it, and she said Patsy must go. Then
my father said he would take him to his
office every day, and keep him out of mischief,
and then I could take the dear for a good
walk in the afternoon, and have a comfortable
time with him, and he could sleep in the
shed. Well, I thought this was a delightful
plan, and the next day Patsy went off with
papa, as pleased and happy as possible. Oh,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
dear! Hugh, what do you think that puppy
did?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps he bit his legs," suggested Hugh,
with a gleam of delight in his blue eyes.</p>

<p>"Oh, no!" said Hildegarde. "He wouldn't
have dared to do that, for he was a sad
coward, my poor Patsy. My father left him
shut up in the office while he went to lunch;
and as the day was mild (though it was
winter), he left his new ulster on a chair,
where he had laid it when he first came in.
Hugh, when he came back, he found the ulster&mdash;it
was a stout heavy one&mdash;he found it all
torn into little pieces, and the pieces piled in
a heap, and Patsy lying on top of them."</p>

<p>"Oh-ee!" cried the boy. "And <i>then</i> what
happened? Did he smite him hip and thigh,
even unto the going down of the sun?"</p>

<p>Hildegarde opened her eyes a little at this
scriptural phrase, but answered: "Yes, I am
afraid papa gave him a pretty severe whipping.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
He had to, of course. And then he
sent him away, and I never saw poor Patsy
again. Don't you think that was sad,
Hugh?"</p>

<p>"It was sad for you," replied the boy,
"but sadder for Patsy. Would you like to
be a dog?" he added, looking up suddenly
into Hildegarde's face.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;think&mdash;not!" said that young woman
meditatively. "I should have to eat
scraps and cold bones, and that I could not
endure. Besides, you couldn't read, or play
on the piano, or anything of that sort. No,
I am quite sure I should not like it, Hugh."</p>

<p>"But you would have a tail!" cried the
boy, with kindling eyes. "A tail to wag!
And&mdash;and just think how you would <i>go</i> with
four legs!" he added, giving a jump with his
two stout little limbs. "And never to have
to sit up straight, except for fun sometimes;
and no boots to lace, and not to have to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
cut up your dinner. Oh! it would be such
fun!"</p>

<p>"Yes, and never to be able to change your
clothes when they are wet or muddy," replied
the girl, "and to have to lie on the floor"&mdash;"I
like to lie on the floor," put in Hugh&mdash;"and
to have unnatural people, who don't
like dogs, say, 'There! there! get away, dog!'
when you are trying to make yourself agreeable."</p>

<p>"Yes, that is bad!" Hugh admitted.
"Aunt Loftus beat Merlin yesterday when
he hadn't done anything, just not anything
at all. Just he wagged his tail to tell me
something, and there was an old jug in the
way, and it fell over and broke. And now
he isn't to come into the house any more. I
felt like 'many oxen come about me, fat bulls
of Basan compass me on every side,' when
she glared at me and said that."</p>

<p>Hildegarde turned her face away, and was
silent for a minute.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span></p>

<p>"Merlin is your dog?" she asked presently,
with a suspicious quiver in her voice.</p>

<p>"Would you like to see him?" cried the
lad joyfully. "He stayed behind with a
bone, but I'll call him." He gave a long, clear
whistle, and a superb collie came bounding
down the avenue, and greeted his master
with violent affection.</p>

<p>"Down, Merlin!" said Hugh Allen gravely.
"This is the Purple Maid I told you about,
but her real name is Hilda. A Purple Maid
was what I called you when I saw you coming
up the steps," he explained, turning to
Hildegarde. "I didn't know any other name,
you see."</p>

<p>"But why 'Purple Maid'?" asked Hildegarde,
feeling more and more that this was
a very queer little boy. "I had been walking
fast, but was I actually purple, Hugh?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no!" said the boy. "It wasn't that
at all. Your cheeks were like the rosy eve.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
But 'purple' has a nice sound, don't you
think so? a kind of rich sound. Do you
mind my calling you a Purple Maid?"</p>

<p>Hildegarde assured him that she did not,
and then, from mere idle curiosity, as she
afterwards assured herself, she added, "And
what do you call your cousin Leonie?"</p>

<p>"A vinegar cruet!" replied Hugh promptly.
"And Aunt Loftus is a fat&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, hush! hush! my dear little boy!"
cried Hildegarde hastily. "You must not say
such things as that."</p>

<p>"You asked me," replied Hugh simply.
"That is what I do call them when I think
about them."</p>

<p>"But it is not nice to think rude and unkind
things," said the Purple Maid, reprovingly.</p>

<p>"Then I won't think about them at all,"
said the boy. "For they really are, you
know. I'd rather think of you, anyhow, and
mamma, and Merlin."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span></p>

</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span></p>

<p>While this dialogue was going on, Hildegarde
had been making friends with Merlin,
who responded with cheerful cordiality to her
advances. He was a beautiful creature, of
true collie brown, with a black nose, and
the finest white waistcoat in the world. His
eyes were wonderful, clear, deep, and intelligent,
in colour "like mountain water when
it's flowing o'er a rock."</p>

<p>"Dear lad!" said Hildegarde, taking his
black paw and pressing it affectionately.
"I know you are as good as you are handsome.
Will you be my friend, too? Hugh
is going to be my friend."</p>

<p>"He will!" cried Hugh eagerly. "We
always like the same people, and <i>almost</i>
always the same things. He won't eat apples,
and I don't chase cats; but those are
nearly the only things we don't like together."</p>

<p>At a turn in the road, Hildegarde saw in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
the distance a black figure walking toward
them.</p>

<p>"There is my mother dear!" she exclaimed.
"She said she would come and
meet me. Will you come and see her,
Hugh?&mdash;she is <i>very</i> nice!" she added, seeing
that the boy hung back. But Hugh studied
his boots again with rapt attention, and
apparently read in them a summons back to The
Poplars.</p>

<p>"I think I have to go back!" he said.
"I love you, and you are my Purple Maid.
May I come to see you once?"</p>

<p>"You may come fifty times, dear little
lad!" cried Hildegarde warmly. "Come as
often as you like."</p>

<p>But Hugh Allen shook his head sagely.
"Maybe once will be enough," he said.
"Come, Merlin! Good-by, Purple Maid!"
And he and Merlin disappeared in a cloud
of legs and dust.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE COUSINS.</div>


<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">Hildegarde</span> and her cousin Jack soon
became fast friends. His fear of Mrs. Grahame
vanished the first time he saw her
smile, and he found, to his great amazement,
that a girl was not necessarily either "dreadful"
or stupid; moreover, that a girl's
mother might be a very delightful person,
instead of a mixture of harpy and Gorgon.
He was invited to come to tea and bring his
violin. Colonel Ferrers was invited, too, but
promptly declined.</div>

<p>"A fiddling nephew, dear madam," he
said, "is a dispensation to which I resign
myself, but I do not wish to hear him fiddle.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>"</p>

<p>Mrs. Grahame suggested that the fiddle
might be left at home.</p>

<p>"No, no! Let him bring it! by all means
let him bring it! if you can really endure it
without discomfort, that is. It will be the
greatest pleasure to the lad, who is a good
lad, though a deplorable milksop."</p>

<p>So Jack came with the precious black box
under his arm. Tea was set out on the
verandah, a symphony in white and gold,&mdash;golden
croquettes, butter, honey, snowy rolls,
and cream cheese,&mdash;and Hildegarde pouring
the tea, in white with gold-coloured ribbons at
waist and throat.</p>

<p>Jack Ferrers had never seen anything of
this sort. "Daddy" and he had always been
together, and neither of them had ever cared
or thought how anything looked. He wondered
if his cousin Hildegarde was very frivolous.
Girls were, of course; and yet&mdash;she
was certainly very pretty; and, if she really<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
cared for music&mdash;and then, being eighteen
and hungry, he gave his undivided attention
to the croquettes, which truly deserved it.</p>

<p>And after tea, when they had sat quiet in
the twilight for a little, Hildegarde said
softly, "Now, Cousin Jack!" And Jack
took his violin and began to play.</p>

<p>At the first note Mrs. Grahame laid down
her knitting; at the second, she and Hildegarde
exchanged glances; at the third, they
forgot each other and everything else save
the music. First came a few simple chords,
melting into a soft harmony, a prelude as
low and sweet as the notes of the mother-bird
brooding over her nest; then, suddenly, from
this soft cloud of peaceful harmony there
leaped a wonderful melody, clear and keen as
the same bird's song at daybreak,&mdash;a melody
that mounted higher and higher, soaring as
the lark breasts the blue morning, flight upon
flight of golden notes pouring out as if the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
violin were a living thing, a breathing, singing
creature, with heart and soul filled and
brimming over with love and joy and beauty.</p>

<p>On and on the boy played, while the two
women listened spellbound, feeling that this
was no ordinary playing; and as he played
his whole aspect seemed to change. He
straightened himself and stood erect, save
for the loving bend of the head over the
beloved instrument. His blue eyes flashed,
his whole countenance grew luminous, intense.
The gawky, listless, indolent lad was
gone; and one saw only the musician rapt
in his art.</p>

<p>When it was over, they were all silent for
a moment. Then Mrs. Grahame held out
her hand. "My dear boy!" she said. "My
dear Jack, you ought to be the happiest
fellow in the world. To be able to give and
to enjoy such pleasure as this, is indeed a
great privilege."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span></p>

<p>Hildegarde could only look her thanks, for
the music had moved her deeply; but her
smile told Jack all that he wanted to know,
and it appeared that girls were not all frivolous;
also that it must be very nice to have
a mother.</p>

<p>Then he played again. Indeed, they left
him no choice,&mdash;the Mozart concerto, of
which he had spoken, and then one lovely
thing after another, barcarolle and serenade
and fairy dance, melting finally into the exquisite
melody of an old Gaelic lullaby.</p>

<p>"Oh!" said Hildegarde, under her breath;
and then, as her mother bade her, she sang
softly the words she loved,&mdash;</p>

<div class='center'>
"Slumber sweetly, little Donald."<br />
</div>

<p>Such a happy evening it was, on the wide
verandah, with the moon shining down, softening
everything into magical wonders of
ivory and silver!</p>

<p>It was the first of many such evenings, for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
soon Jack came to spending half his time at
Braeside. At nine o'clock Colonel Ferrers
would come striding up the gravel walk,
swinging his big stick; and then the violin
would be tenderly laid away, and half an
hour of pleasant chat would follow, after
which uncle and nephew would go off together,
and the last the two ladies heard of
them would be passionate adjurations from
the former to "step out," and not to "poke
your head forward like an army mule following
a grain-cart, sir!"</p>

<p>One day the two cousins were taking a
walk together. At least they had been walking,
and now had sat down to rest on the
mossy trunk of a fallen tree,&mdash;in fact, of the
same great sycamore which Hildegarde had
christened Philemon, on the memorable day
of the tree-climbing. They had been talking
about everything and nothing, when suddenly
Jack shook his head and began earnestly,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
"Did your mother mean that the other
night?"</p>

<p>Hildegarde simply looked at him, and raised
her eyebrows.</p>

<p>"I mean about my being happy," the boy
continued. "Because I'm not happy, and I
never expect to be."</p>

<p>"What is it?" Hildegarde asked, seeing
that a confidence was coming.</p>

<p>"There is only one thing in the world that
I want," cried the boy, "and that is just
what I cannot have. I want to go to Leipsic,
and Uncle Tom won't hear of it; calls it
nonsense, and is going to send me to Harvard.
We are poor, you know; Daddy doesn't know
anything about money, and&mdash;and who cares
about it, anyhow, except for&mdash;for things one
wants? Uncle Tom says I can't make a bow,
and&mdash;oh, all kinds of rubbish! What's the
use of making a bow? I'm not going to be a
dancing-master, Hildegarde!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span></p>

<p>"Indeed, you would not be a good one!"
his cousin said; "but, considering that one
must make bows, Jack, isn't it just as well to
do it well as to do it badly?"</p>

<p>"Who cares?" cried the boy, shaking his
head wildly. "If a man is going to <i>be</i> anything,
who cares how he bows? And&mdash;oh,
of course that is one item. I am to go to
Harvard, and learn to bow and to dance, and
to be a classical scholar, and to play base-ball.
I <i>hate</i> base-ball, Hilda! it's perfect idiocy, and
it makes my head ache, and any one can see
that I'm not cut out for athletics. Are you
laughing at me?"</p>

<p>"Indeed I am not!" said Hildegarde,
heartily. "But, tell me! you want to go to
Leipsic, to study music?"</p>

<p>"Of course!" was the reply. "And Daddy
wants me to go, and Herr Geigen is going over
in the autumn, and he would place me, and
all; but Uncle Tom hates music, you know,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
and if I speak of it he goes off in a rage, and
talks about rascally Dutch fiddlers, and says
I walk like a giraffe with the palsy. At least,
that was the animal this morning. Yesterday
I was a gouty ostrich, and I suppose we shall
go through the whole menagerie."</p>

<p>"You like him?" Hildegarde said interrogatively.</p>

<p>"He is <i>very</i> kind, in his way," replied
Jack. "Awfully kind, and he loves my
father, and I know he wants to do things
for me; but&mdash;it all has to be done in his
way, don't you see? And&mdash;well, there isn't
anything in me except music. I know that,
you see, Hildegarde. Just nothing!"</p>

<p>"I don't feel so sure of that!" Hildegarde
said. "Perhaps you never tried to develop
the other side of you. There must be other
sides, you know."</p>

<p>"No, there aren't!" said Jack positively.
"None at all!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span></p>

<p>"But that is nonsense!" cried Hildegarde
impatiently. "Do you mean to say that you
are a flat surface, like a playing-card, with
'music' painted on you?"</p>

<p>"I didn't know I was flat!" rather stiffly.</p>

<p>"You see, you are not! then why not try to
care for something else <i>beside</i> music, without
caring any the less for that?"</p>

<p>"What is there to care for? a parcel of
musty old books, such as Uncle Tom is forever
reading."</p>

<p>"Oh! oh! you Goth! As if it were not a
rapture simply to look at the outside of your
uncle's books. To see my heart's own Doctor
in dark blue calf, with all that beautiful tooling&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What Doctor? what are you talking
about, Hildegarde?"</p>

<p>"Johnson, of course! Is there another?
as the man in <i>Punch</i> says about his hatter.
And even in your own line, you foolish boy!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
Have you never read that beautiful 'Life of
Handel'? I looked into it the other day, and
it seemed delightful."</p>

<p>"No," said Jack, looking blank. "Where
is it? I never saw it."</p>

<p>"Bookcase between the south windows,
fourth shelf, about the middle; three fat volumes
in green morocco. And you never saw
it, because you never look at the books at all.
What <i>do</i> you look at, Jack, except your music
and your violin? For example, do you ever
look in the glass? I know you don't."</p>

<p>"How do you know?" and Jack blushed
hotly.</p>

<p>"Because&mdash;you won't mind? I am your
cousin, you know!&mdash;because your necktie is
so often crooked. It is crooked now; a little
more to the right! that's it! And&mdash;and you
ought to brush that spot off your coat. Now,
if you made it a point always to look in the
glass before leaving your room&mdash;"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span></p>

<p>"Is that one of the sides you want me to
develop?" asked Jack slowly. "Caring about
dress, and looks, and that sort of thing? I
didn't know you were of that kind, Hildegarde."</p>

<p>"Of what kind?" cried our heroine, blushing
furiously in her turn, and feeling that she
was in great danger of losing her temper.
"I certainly do care about my dress and
looks, as every one ought to do. Suppose the
next time you came to tea, you found me with
my hair tumbling down, and a great spot of
ink on my gown, and my ruffles torn! Is
that the kind of person you like to see? I
always thought Herrick's Julia was a most
untidy young woman, with her shoe-strings,
and her 'erring lace' and all."</p>

<p>"I don't know who she is," said Jack
meekly. "But I beg your pardon if I was
rude, Hilda; and&mdash;and I will try to 'spruce
up,' as Uncle Tom is always trying to make<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
me. You see," he added shyly, "when <i>you</i>
look in the glass you see something nice, and
I don't!"</p>

<p>"Nonsense!" said Hildegarde, promptly.
"And then, Jack&mdash;that is only one thing, of
course. But if you had the habit of using
your eyes! Oh! you don't know what a
difference it would make. I know, because
I used to be as blind as you are. I never
looked at anything till about two years ago.
And now&mdash;of course I am only learning
still, and shall be learning all my life, I hope;
but&mdash;well, I do see things more or less. For
example, what do you see at our feet here?"</p>

<p>"Grass!" said Jack, peering about.
"Green grass. Do you think I don't know
that?"</p>

<p>Hildegarde laughed, and clapped her hands.</p>

<p>"Just what I should have said two years
ago!" she cried. "There are twelve different
plants that I know&mdash;I've been counting<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
them&mdash;and several more that are new to
me."</p>

<p>"Well, they're all green, anyhow!" said
Jack. "What's the difference?"</p>

<p>Hildegarde scorned a direct reply, but went
on, being now mounted on her own hobby.</p>

<p>"And as for moths, Jack, you can have
no idea of what my ignorance was in regard
to moths."</p>

<p>"Oh, come!" said Jack. "Every one
knows about moths, of course. They eat our
clothes, and fly into the lamps. That is one
of the things one finds out when one is a
baby, I suppose."</p>

<p>"Indeed!" cried Hildegarde. "And that
is all there is to find out, I suppose. Why&mdash;"
she stopped suddenly; then said in a very
different tone, "Oh, Jack! this is a wonderful
coincidence. Look! oh, <i>will</i> you look?
oh! the beautiful, beautiful dear! Get me
something! anything! quick!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span></p>

<p>Jack, who was not accustomed to feminine
ways, wondered if his fair cousin was going
out of her mind. She was gazing intently at
a spot of lighter green on the "grass" at her
feet. Presently the spot moved, spread; developed
two great wings, delicate, exquisite,
in colour like a chrysoprase, or the pure, cold
green one sometimes sees in a winter sunset.</p>

<p>"What is it?" asked Jack, in wonder.</p>

<p>"A Luna!" cried Hildegarde. "Hush!
slip off on the other side, quietly! <i>Fly</i> to
the house, and ask auntie for a fly-screen.
<i>Quick</i>, Jack!"</p>

<p>Jack, greatly wondering, ran off none the
less, his long legs scampering with irreverent
haste through the Ladies' Garden. Returning
with the screen, which auntie gave him without
question, being well used to the sudden
frenzies of a moth-collector, he found Hildegarde
on her knees, holding her handkerchief
over the great moth, which fortunately had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
remained quiet, being indeed stupid in the
strong light. The girl's face was all aglow
with triumph and delight.</p>

<p>"A perfect specimen," she cried, as she
skilfully conveyed the great moth under the
screen. "I have two, but the tails are a
little broken. Isn't he glorious, Jack? Oh,
happy day! Come, good cousin, and let us
take him home in a triumphal procession."</p>

<p>Jack looked rather blank. "Are you going
home now?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Of course, to put my beauty in the
ammonia jar."</p>

<p>"What is it?" she added, seeing that her
cousin looked really vexed.</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;nothing!" said Jack. "Nothing
of any consequence. I am ready."</p>

<p>"But <i>what</i> is it?" Hildegarde repeated.
"You would a great deal better tell me than
look like that, for I know I have done something
to vex you."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well&mdash;I am not used to girls, you know,
Hildegarde, and perhaps I am stupid. Only&mdash;well,
I was going to ask you seriously
what you thought about&mdash;my music, and all
that; and first you tell me to look in the
glass, and then you go to catching moths and
forget all about me. I suppose it's all right,
only&mdash;"</p>

<p>He blushed, and evidently did not think it
<i>was</i> all right. Hildegarde blushed, too, in
real distress.</p>

<p>"My <i>dear</i> Jack," she cried, "how shall I
tell you how sorry I am?"</p>

<p>She looked about for a suitable place, and
then carefully set down the fly-screen with
its precious contents.</p>

<p>"Sit down again," she cried, motioning
her cousin to take his place on the fallen
tree, while she did the same. "And you will
not believe now how interested I really am,"
she said. "Mamma would never have been<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
so stupid, nor Rose either. But you must
believe me. I <i>was</i> thinking about you till&mdash;till
I saw the Luna, and you don't know
what a Luna means when one hasn't a perfect
specimen. But now, tell me, do you
think it would be quite impossible to persuade
your uncle? Why, you <i>must</i> go to Leipsic,
of course you must. He&mdash;has he ever heard
you play, Jack?"</p>

<p>Jack laughed rather bitterly. "Once," he
said. "He cried out that when he wanted
to listen to cats with their tails tied together,
he would tie them himself. Since then I
always go up into the garret to practise, and
shut all the doors and windows."</p>

<p>"What a pity! and he is so nice when one
knows him. I wonder&mdash;do you know, Jack,
what I am thinking of?"</p>

<p>Her face was so bright that the boy's face
brightened as he looked at it.</p>

<p>"I hope it is what I was thinking of," he
said; "but I didn't dare&mdash;"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span></p>

<p>"Mamma," cried Hildegarde.</p>

<p>He nodded in delight, colouring with
pleasure.</p>

<p>"She is just the person."</p>

<p>"Of course she is; but will she?"</p>

<p>"Of course she will. I am sure of it.
Your uncle shall come to tea some evening,
and you shall stay at home. I will go away
to write letters, and then&mdash;oh, you see,
Jack, no one can resist mamma."</p>

<p>"What a good fellow you are, Hildegarde!
Oh, I <i>beg</i> your pardon!"</p>

<p>"Never mind!" cried Hildegarde merrily.
"I did climb the tree, you know. And now,
come along. I must take my beauty, my
love, my moonlight rapture, up to his death."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>BONNY SIR HUGH.</div>


<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">Meanwhile</span> Hildegarde had not lost sight
of little Hugh Allen, the one link of interest
which connected her with The Poplars. He,
too, had been won by Mrs. Grahame's smile,
and had learned the way to Braeside; and
the more they saw of him, the more Hildegarde
and her mother felt that he was a
very remarkable little boy.</div>

<p>Much of the time he seemed to be lost in
dreams, wrapped in a cloud of silent thought;
and, again, from this cloud would flash out
the quaintest sayings, sudden outbursts of
passionate feeling, which were startling to
quiet, every-day people. When he had been<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
walking with Mrs. Grahame, as he was fond
of doing (sneaking out by the back gate from
his prison-place, as he called it, and making a
<i>d&eacute;tour</i> to reach the road where she most
often walked), and when she said, "Now,
dear, it is time to say good-by, and go home,"
he would throw himself on his knees, and
hold up his clasped hands, crying, "How can
I leave thee?" in a manner which positively
embarrassed her.</p>

<p>Now it happened one day that Hugh was
sitting with Merlin beside the brook that
flowed at the foot of the Ladies' Garden.
Hildegarde had told him to come through
the garden and wait for her, and it was his
first visit to the lovely, silent place. The
child went dreaming along between the high
box hedges, stopping occasionally to look
about him and to exchange confidences with
his dog. Merlin seemed to feel the influence
of the place, and went along quietly, with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
bent head and drooping tail. When the
murmur of the hidden streamlet first fell
upon his ear, "It is like the fishpools of
Heshbon," said the boy dreamily. "Isn't
it, Merlin? I never understood before."
Merlin put his cool black nose in his master's
hand, and gave a little sympathetic shake.</p>

<p>And now the pair were sitting on a bank of
moss, looking down into the dark, clear water,
which moved so swiftly yet so silently, with
only a faint sound, which somehow seemed no
louder than when they were at a distance.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 334px;"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201"></a>

<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Hildegarde finding Hugh and Merlin by the Brook.</span></span>
</div>

<p>"Do you see that dark round place where
it is deep, Merlin?" said the child. "Do
you think that under there lives a fair woman
with green hair, who takes a person by the
hand, and kisses him, and pulls him down?
Do you think that, Merlin?" But Merlin
sneezed, and shook his head, and evidently
thought nothing of the kind. "Then do you
think about fishes?" the boy went on.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
"Dark little fishes, with gleaming eyes, who
are sad because they cannot speak. I wish I
knew your thoughts, Merlin."</p>

<p>"Wuff!" said Merlin, in his voice of welcome,
raising his head, and becoming instantly
a living image of cheerfulness. Hugh
looked, and there was his Purple Maid, all
bright and shining, standing among the green
trees, and smiling at him. The child's face
flushed with such vivid light that the place
seemed brighter. He held out his arms with
a passionate gesture that would have been
theatrical if it had not been so real, but remained
silent.</p>

<p>"Dear!" said Hildegarde. "How quiet
you are, you and Merlin! I could not tell
whether it was your voice or the brook, talking."
The boy and dog made room for her
between them, and she sat down. "Aren't
you going to speak to me, Hugh?" she continued,
as he still said nothing.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span></p>

<p>"I spoke to myself," said the boy. "When
I saw you stand there, angelic, in the green,
'Blessed heart of woman!' I said to myself.
Do you like the sound of that?"</p>

<p>"My bonny Sir Hugh!" said Hildegarde,
laying her hand caressingly on the red-gold
hair. "I do like the sound of it. And do
you like this place? I want you to care for
it as I do."</p>

<p>The boy nodded. "It is the place of dead
people," he said. "We are too alive to be
here."</p>

<p>"I call it the Ladies' Garden," said Hildegarde
softly. "Fair, sweet ladies lived here
once, and loved it. They used to sit here,
Hugh, and wander up and down the green
paths, and fill the place with sweet, gentle
words. I don't believe they sang; Hester
may have sung, perhaps."</p>

<p>"Were they fair as the moon, clear as the
sun?" asked the child.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span></p>

<p>"Where did you find those sweet words,
Sir Hugh?"</p>

<p>"In the Bible. 'Fair as the moon, clear as
the sun, terrible as an army with banners.'
And 'thy neck is a tower of ivory.' Were
they terrible, do you think?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no! they were very gentle, I think,
very soft and mild, like folds of old soft cashmere;
only Hester was blithe and gay, and
she died, Hugh, when she was just my age.
Think of it! to die so young and go away
out of all the sunshine."</p>

<p>The child looked at her with strange eyes.
"Why do you be sad?" he said. "Don't you
know about your Mother dear Jerusalem?"</p>

<p>"A little," said Hildegarde. "Tell me
what you are thinking, Sir Hugh."</p>

<p>"It is greener there," said the child, "and
brighter. Don't you know, blessed heart?
'Where grow such sweet and pleasant flowers
as nowhere else are seen.' And more coloured<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
words. Don't you love coloured words?"
The girl laid her hand on his lightly, but
said nothing, and he went on as if in a
dream.</p>

<div class='poem'>
"'Thy houses are of ivory,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Thy windows crystal clear,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Thy streets are laid with beaten gold&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">There angels do appear.'</span><br />
</div>

<p>"Two of them are papa and mamma," he
added after a pause. "Do you think they
mind waiting for me very much? At first I
wanted to go to them&mdash;oh, so badly! because
those people are devils, and I would
rather die; but now I have you, Purple
Maid, and your mother is like balm dropping
in the valley, and I don't mind waiting, if
only I thought <i>they</i> didn't mind it too much."
He looked up wistfully, and Hildegarde bent
to kiss him.</p>

<p>"How long is it, dear?" she asked softly.</p>

<p>"A year now, a very long year, only I had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
Merlin. And Uncle Loftus took me out of
charity, he said; but mamma said I was to
go to Aunt Martha, so that makes me feel
wrong, even if I wanted to stay with them,
and it is the pains of hell to me."</p>

<p>"Aunt Martha?" asked Hildegarde, willing
to ask more, yet dreading to rouse the
boy's scriptural eloquence on the subject of
his relatives at The Poplars.</p>

<p>Hugh nodded. "Mamma's aunt," he said.
"She lives somewhere, not far from here, but
I don't know where; and Uncle Loftus won't
tell me, or let me see her, 'cause she is a menial.
What is a menial, dearly beloved?"</p>

<p>"Did your uncle say that to you?" Hildegarde
asked, waiving the question.</p>

<p>"He said it <i>at</i> me!" was the reply. "At
my back, but I heard it. She was a menial,
and he wasn't going to have folks saying that
his aunt was housekeeper to a stuck-up old
bear, just because she was a fool and had no<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
proper spirit. And the others said 'hush!'
and I went away, and now they won't let me
speak about her."</p>

<p>"Housekeeper to a&mdash;why!" began Hildegarde;
and then she was silent, and
smoothed the child's hair thoughtfully. An
old bear! that was what Mr. Loftus had
vulgarly called Colonel Ferrers. Could it be
possible that&mdash;Jack had told her about dear,
good Mrs. Beadle, who had been nurse to his
father and uncle, and who was so devoted to
them all, and such a superior woman. She
had been meaning to go to see her the next
time she was at Roseholme. Was there a
mystery here? was Mrs. Beadle the plump
and comfortable skeleton in the Loftus closet?
She must ask Jack.</p>

<p>As she mused thus, the child had fallen
a-dreaming again, and they both sat for some
time silent, with the soft falling of the water
in their ears, and all the dim, shadowy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
beauty of the place filling their hearts with
vague delight.</p>

<p>Presently, "Beloved," said Hugh (he wavered
between this and "Purple Maid" as
names for Hildegarde, wholly ignoring her
own name), "Beloved, there is an angel near
me. Did you know it?"</p>

<p>"There might well be angels in this place,"
said Hildegarde, looking at the boy, whose
wide blue eyes wore a far-away, spiritual look.</p>

<p>"I don't mean just here in this spot. I
mean floating through the air at night. I
hear him, almost every night, playing on his
harp of gold."</p>

<p>"Dear Hugh, tell me a little more clearly."</p>

<p>"Sometimes the moon shines in at my window
and wakes me up, you know. Then I
get up and look out, for it is so like heaven,
only silver instead of gold; and then&mdash;then
I hear the angel play."</p>

<p>"What does it sound like?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span></p>

<p>"Sometimes like a voice, sometimes like
birds. And then it sobs and cries, and dies
away, and then it sounds out again, like
'blow up the trumpet in the new moon,' and
goes up, up, up, oh, so high! Do you think
that is when the angel goes up to the gate,
and then is sorry for people here, and comes
back again? I have thought of that."</p>

<p>"My bonny Sir Hugh!" said Hildegarde
gently. "Would you care less about the lovely
music if it was not really made by an angel?
if it was a person like you and me, who had
the power and the love to make such beautiful
sounds?"</p>

<p>The child's face lightened. "Was it you?"
he said in an awe-struck voice.</p>

<p>"Not I, dear, but my cousin, my cousin
Jack, who plays the violin most beautifully,
Hugh. He practises every night, up in the
garret at Roseholme, because&mdash;only think!
his uncle does not like to hear him."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span></p>

<p>"The ostrich gentleman!" cried Hugh,
bursting into merry laughter. "Is it the
ostrich gentleman?"</p>

<p>Hildegarde tried to look grave, with moderate
success. "My cousin is tall," she said,
"but you must not call names, little lad!"</p>

<p>"Never any more will I call him it," cried
Hugh, "if he is really the angel. But he
does look like one. Must we go?" he asked
wistfully, as Hildegarde rose, and held out
her hand to him.</p>

<p>"Yes, dear, I am going to the village, you
know. I thought we would come this way
because I wanted you to see the Ladies'
Garden. Now we must go across the
meadow, and round by the back of Roseholme
to find the road again."</p>

<p>They crossed the brook by some mossy
stepping-stones, and climbed the dark slope
on the further side, thick-set with ferns and
dusky hemlock-trees. Then came the wall,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
and then the sudden break into the sunny
meadow. Hugh threw off his grave mood
with the shadow, and danced and leaped in
the sunshine.</p>

<p>"Shall I run with Merlin?" he asked.
"You have never seen us run, Beloved!"</p>

<p>Hildegarde nodded, and with a shout and a
bark the two were off. A pretty sight they
were! the boy's golden head bobbing up and
down in full energy of running, the dog
bounding beside him with long, graceful
leaps. They breasted the long, low hill, then
swept round in a wide circle, and came rushing
past Hildegarde, breathless and radiant.
This was more than our heroine could bear.
With a merry "Hark, follow!" she started
in pursuit, and was soon running abreast of
the others, with head thrown back, eyes
sparkling, cheeks glowing.</p>

<p>"Hurrah!" cried Hugh.</p>

<p>"Hurrah it is!" echoed the Purple Maid.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span></p>

<p>"Wow, <i>wow!</i>" panted Merlin, ecstatically.</p>

<p>As the chase swept round the hill the
second time, two gentlemen came out of the
woods, and paused in amazement at the sight.
Hildegarde's long hair had come down, and
was flying in the wind; her two companions
were frantic with delight, and bobbed and
leaped, shouting, beside her. So bright was
the sunshine, so vivid in colour, so full of life
the three runners, they seemed actually to
flash as they moved.</p>

<p>"Harry Monmouth!" cried Colonel Ferrers.
"Here is a girl who knows how to run. Look
at that action! It's poetry, sir! it's rhythm
and metre and melody.</p>

<div class='poem'>
"'Nor lighter does the swallow skim<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Along the smooth lake's airy rim.'</span><br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'>After her, Master Milksop, and let me see
what your long legs can do!"</div>

<p>Jack Ferrers needed no second bidding,
and though his running was not graceful,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
being rather a hurling himself forward, as if
he were catapult and missile in one, he got
over the ground with great rapidity, and
caught his cousin up as she came flying round
the meadow for the third time. Hildegarde
stopped short, in great confusion.</p>

<p>"Jack!" she faltered, panting. "How&mdash;where
did you come from? You must have
started up out of the earth."</p>

<p>Turning to capture her flying tresses, she
caught sight of Colonel Ferrers, and her confusion
was redoubled.</p>

<p>"Oh!" she cried, the crimson mounting
from her cheeks to her forehead, bathing her
in a fiery tide. "Oh! how could you? He&mdash;he
will be <i>sure</i> I am a tomboy now."</p>

<p>"Nothing of the kind, my fair Atalanta!"
exclaimed the Colonel, who had the ears of
a fox. He advanced, beaming, and flourishing
his stick. "Nothing of the kind!" he
repeated. "He is delighted, on the contrary,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
to see a young creature who can make the
free movements of nature with nature's grace
and activity. Harry Monmouth! Miss Hildegarde,
I wish I were twenty years younger,
and I would challenge you to a race myself!"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>A CALL AND A CONSPIRACY.</div>


<div class='unindent'>"<span class="smcap">And</span> you really seriously intend passing
the winter here?" asked Miss Leonie Loftus.</div>

<p>This young lady had come to make a parting
call at Braeside. It was near the end of
August, and three months of country life
were all that she could possibly endure, and
she was going with her mother to Long
Branch, and thence to Saratoga.</p>

<p>"You really mean it?" she repeated, looking
incredulous.</p>

<p>"Assuredly!" replied Hildegarde, smiling.
"Winter and summer, and winter again, Miss
Loftus. This is our home now, and we have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
become attached to it even in these few
months."</p>

<p>"Oh, you look at it in a sentimental light,"
said Miss Loftus, with a disagreeable smile.
"The domestic hearth, and that sort of thing.
Rather old-fashioned, isn't it, Miss Grahame?"</p>

<p>"Possibly; I have never thought of it as a
matter of fashion," was the quiet reply.</p>

<p>"And how do you expect to kill time in
your wilderness?" was the next question.</p>

<p>"Kill him?" Hildegarde laughed. "We
never can catch him, even for a moment,
Miss Loftus. He flies faster at Braeside than
even in New York. I sometimes think there
are only two days in the week, Monday and
Saturday."</p>

<p>"I hear you have a sewing-school in the village.
I suppose that will take up some time."</p>

<p>"I hope so! The children seem interested,
and it is a great pleasure to me. Then,
too, I expect to join some of Miss Wayland's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
classes in the fall, and that will keep me
busy, of course."</p>

<p>"Miss Wayland, over in Dorset? Why, it
is three miles off."</p>

<p>"And even if so? I hear it is a delightful
school, and Miss Wayland herself is very
lovely. Do you know her?"</p>

<p>"No!" said Miss Loftus, who had been
"dying" as she would have put it, to get
into Miss Wayland's school three years before.
"A country boarding-school isn't <i>my</i> idea of
education."</p>

<p>"Oh!" said Hildegarde civilly. "But to
go back for a moment, Miss Loftus. Your
speaking of the children reminds me to ask
you, is little Hugh going with you to Long
Branch?"</p>

<p>Miss Loftus coloured. "Oh, dear, no!" she
replied. "A child at such places, you know,
is out of the question. He is to be sent to
school. He is going next week."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span></p>

<p>"But&mdash;pardon me! are not all schools in
vacation now?"</p>

<p>"I believe so! But these people&mdash;the
Miss Hardhacks&mdash;are willing to take him
now, and keep him."</p>

<p>"Poor little lad!" murmured Hildegarde,
regardless of the fact that it was none of her
business. "Will he not be very lonely?"</p>

<p>"Beggars must not be choosers, Miss Grahame!"
was the reply, with another unamiable
smile. Miss Loftus really would not have
smiled at all, if she had known how she
looked.</p>

<p>No sooner was the visitor gone, than Hildegarde
flew up to her mother with the news.
The Loftuses were going away; they were
going to send Hugh to school. What was to
be done? He could not go! He <i>should</i> not
go.</p>

<p>She was greatly excited, but Mrs. Grahame's
quiet voice and words restored her composure.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
"'Can't' and 'shan't' never won a battle!"
said that lady. "We must think and
plan."</p>

<p>Hildegarde had lately discovered, beyond
peradventure, from some chance words let
fall by little Hugh, that his mother had been
the sister of Mr. Loftus; and she felt no doubt
in her own mind that good Mrs. Beadle was
aunt to both. The sister had been a school
teacher, had married a man of some education,
who died during the second year of their
marriage, leaving her alone, in a Western
town, with her little baby. She had struggled
on, not wishing to be a burden either on
her rich brother (who had not approved her
marriage) or her aunt, who had nothing but
her savings and her comfortable berth at
Roseholme. At length, consumption laying
its deadly hand on her, she sent for her
brother, and begged him to take the boy to
their good aunt, who, she knew, would care<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
for him as her own. "But he didn't!" said
Hugh. "He did not do that. He said he
would make a man of me, but I don't believe
he could make a very good one, do you,
Beloved?"</p>

<p>Now the question was, how to bring about
a meeting between the boy and his great-aunt,
if great-aunt she were.</p>

<p>No child was allowed to enter the sacred
precincts of Roseholme, for Colonel Ferrers
regarded children, and especially boys, as the
fountain-head of all mischief, flower-breaking,
bird-nesting, turf-destroying. His own
nephew had had to wait eighteen years for an
invitation. How could it be possible to introduce
little Hugh, a boy and a stranger, into
the charmed garden?</p>

<p>If "Mammina" could only take him! No
one could resist her mother, Hildegarde
thought; certainly not Colonel Ferrers, who
admired her so much. But this dear mother<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
had sprained her ankle a week before, slipping
on a mossy stone in the garden, and
was only now beginning to get about, using a
crutched stick.</p>

<p>Mrs. Grahame and Hildegarde put their
heads together, and talked long and earnestly.
Then they sent for Jack, and took counsel
with him; and a plan was made for the first
act of what Hildegarde called the Drama of
the Conspirators.</p>

<p>A day or two after, when Mrs. Beadle drove
to the town of Whitfield, some miles off, on
her weekly marketing trip, it was Jack Ferrers,
instead of Giuseppe, the faithful manservant,
who held the reins and drove the
yellow wagon with the stout brown cob. He
wanted to buy some things, he said: a necktie,
and some chocolate, and&mdash;oh, lots of
things; and Mrs. Beadle was only too glad
of his company. The good housekeeper was
dressed, like Villikins' Dinah, in gorgeous<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
array, her cashmere shawl being of the finest
scarlet, her gown of a brilliant blue, while
her bonnet nodded with blue and yellow cornflowers.
Not a tradesman in Whitfield but
came smiling to his door when he saw Mrs.
Beadle's yellow cart; for she was a good
customer, and wanted everything of the best
for her Colonel. When they at last turned
Chow-chow's head homeward, the wagon was
nearly filled with brown-paper parcels, and
Jack's pockets bulged out in all directions.
As they drove along the pleasant road, fringed
with oaks and beeches, Jack broke silence
with, "Biddy, did you ever have any children?"</p>

<p>"Bless me, Master Jack, how you startled
me!" cried Mrs. Beadle, who was deep in
a problem of jelly and roly-poly pudding.
"No, dear! no jelly&mdash;I should say, no chick
nor child had I ever. I wasn't good enough,
I suppose."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span></p>

<p>"Nonsense. Biddy!" said Jack. "But you
must have had some relations; some&mdash;nieces
or nephews, or something of that sort."</p>

<p>Mrs. Beadle sighed, and fell straightway
into the trap.</p>

<p>"I had, dear! I had, indeed, once upon a
time. But they're no good to me now, and
never will be."</p>

<p>She sighed again.</p>

<p>"How no good to you?" queried this artful
Jack.</p>

<p>"Oh, 'tis a long story, dear, and you
wouldn't care for it at all. You would?
Well! well! there's no harm that I know of
in speaking of it. I've nothing to be ashamed
of. I had a niece, Master Jack, and a dearer
one never was, nor married to a finer young
man. But they went out West, and he died,
and left her with a baby. I wrote again and
again, begging her to come home, but she
was doing well, she said, and felt to stay, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
had friends there, and all. Oh, dear! and last
year&mdash;a year ago it is now, she died." Mrs.
Beadle drew out a handkerchief and wiped
her eyes. "She died, my dear; and&mdash;I
didn't ought to speak of this, Master Jack, it
do upset me so&mdash;I don't know where the
child is to this day."</p>

<p>"Her child?" asked Jack, with a guilty
consciousness of his ears being red.</p>

<p>"My own dear niece Martha's child!"
repeated the good woman sorrowfully. "A
boy it was, as should be seven years old by
this time. I've wrote, and I've wrote, but
no answer could I get. And whether he is
dead, too, or whether his father's people have
him, or what, is darkness to me."</p>

<p>"The brute!" exclaimed Jack Ferrers vehemently.
"The cold-hearted, odious brute!"</p>

<p>"What is it, my dear?" cried Mrs. Beadle,
drying her tears, and looking with alarm at
the pony. "His tail over the reins, is it?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
Well, he will do that, but 'tis only play. He
means no harm."</p>

<p>"Oh, I know!" cried Jack in confusion.
"I didn't mean&mdash;that is&mdash;and is that all
the relatives you have, Biddy?"</p>

<p>"Why, boys do love questions, don't they?"
the good woman said. "I have a nephew
living, Master Jack; and if you guessed from
now till Sunday week, you never would guess
his name."</p>

<p>"Solomon Grundy" rose to Jack's lips, he
could not in the least tell why. He did his
best to look unconscious, but it was perhaps
fortunate that Mrs. Beadle was so absorbed
in her own troubled thoughts that she did not
look at him.</p>

<p>"Who is it?" he asked. "Do tell me.
Biddy! Is it any one I ever heard of?"</p>

<p>"Hush, my dear! don't tell a soul that I
mentioned it. I am not one to force myself
on them as has got up in the world, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
think honest service a disgrace. It's Ephraim
Loftus!"</p>

<p>"Not Mr. Loftus at the Poplars?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Loftus at the Poplars! The very
same. My own sister's son, and little credit
he is to either of us. Don't ask me how
he made his money, for I don't know, and
don't want to know. When he was a little
boy, his pockets were always full of pennies
that he got from the other boys, trading
and the like, and nobody had a kindness
for him, though they loved Martha. Not
a soul in the village but loved Martha,
and would do anything for her. So when
Ephraim was fourteen or so, he went away
to New York, and we never heard anything
more till he came back three or four years
ago, a rich man, and built that great house,
and lived there summers. I've never seen
him but once; I don't go out, only just in
the back garden, except when I drive to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
town. And that once he looked me all over,
as if I was a waxwork in a glass case, and
never stopped nor spoke a word. That's
Ephraim Loftus! He needn't have been
afraid of my troubling him or his, I can tell
him. I wouldn't demean myself." Mrs.
Beadle's face was red, and her voice trembled
with angry pride.</p>

<p>"And&mdash;" Jack wished Hildegarde were
speaking instead of himself; she would know
what to say, and he felt entirely at a loss.
"Do you&mdash;do you suppose he knows anything
about&mdash;about his sister's little boy?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Beadle looked as if some one had
struck her a blow. "Ephraim Loftus!" she
cried. "If I thought that, Master Jack, I'd&mdash;I'd&mdash;why,
what's the matter, sir?" For
Jack had risen in his seat, and was waving
the whip wildly round his head.</p>

<p>"It's my cousin," he said. "Don't you
see her coming?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, the dear young lady! yes, to be sure.
Walking this way, isn't she? Never mind me.
Master Jack!" said the good woman, striving
for composure. "I was upset by what you
said, that's all. It gave me a thought&mdash;who
is the little boy with Miss Grahame, dear?"</p>

<p>"He? oh&mdash;he's a boy," said Jack, rather
incoherently. "His name is Hugh. Good-morning,
Hildegarde! Hallo, Hugh! how
are you?"</p>

<p>"Good-morning!" cried Hildegarde, as the
wagon drew up beside her. "Good-morning,
Mrs. Beadle. Isn't it a lovely day? Will
the pony stand, Jack?"</p>

<p>"Like a rock!" and Jack, obeying the
hint, leaped to the ground.</p>

<p>Mrs. Beadle had turned very pale. She
was gazing fixedly at Hugh, who returned
the look with wide blue eyes, shining with
some strong emotion.</p>

<p>"Dear Mrs. Beadle," said Hildegarde gently,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
taking the housekeeper's hand in hers as she
leant against the wagon, "this is a very
dear little friend of mine, whom I want you
to know. His name is Hugh; Hugh Allen;
and he is staying with his uncle, Mr. Loftus."</p>

<p>"I knew it!" cried Mrs. Beadle, clapping
her hands together. "I knew it! And I am
going to faint!"</p>

<p>"No, don't do that!" said Hugh, climbing
up into the seat beside her. "Don't do that.
You must be calm, for you are my great-aunt,
and I am your little nephew. How
do you do? I am very glad to see you."</p>

<p>"You are sure he will stand?" whispered
Hildegarde.</p>

<p>"Look at him! he is asleep already."</p>

<p>"Then come along!" and the two conspirators
vanished among the trees.</p>

<p>They pushed on a little way through the
tangle of undergrowth, and paused, breathless
and radiant, under a great beech-tree.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span></p>

<p>"Jack," said Hildegarde, "you are a dear!
How did you manage it?"</p>

<p>"I didn't manage it at all. I am a stupid
ninny. Why, I've thrown her into a fit. Do
you think it's safe to leave her alone?"</p>

<p>"Nonsense! a joy fit does not hurt, when
a person is well and strong. Oh! isn't it
delightful! and you have enjoyed it, too,
Jack, haven't you? I am sure you have.
And&mdash;why, you have a new hat! and your
necktie is straight. You look really very
nice, <i>mon cousin!</i>"</p>

<p>"<i>Mille remerciments, ma cousine!</i>" replied
Jack, with a low bow, which, Hildegarde
noticed, was not nearly so like the shutting-up
of a jackknife as it would have been a few
weeks ago. "Am I really improving? You
have no idea what I go through with, looking
in the glass. It is a humiliating practice.
Have some chocolates?" He pulled out a box,
and they crunched in silent contentment.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span></p>

<p>"Now I think we may go back," said
Hildegarde, after her third bonbon. "But
I must tell you first what Hugh said. I told
him the whole story as we walked along; first
as if it were about some one else, you know,
and then when he had taken it all in, I told
him that he himself was the little boy. He
was silent at first, reflecting, as he always
does. Then he said: 'I am like an enchanted
prince, I think. Generally it is fair ones
with golden locks that take them out of
prison, but at my age a great-aunt is better.
Don't you think so, Beloved?' and I did think
so."</p>

<p>"But it <i>was</i> a fair one with golden locks
who planned it all!" Jack said, with a shy
look at his cousin's fair hair.</p>

<p>"Jack, you are learning to pay compliments!"
cried Hildegarde, clapping her hands.
"I believe you will go to Harvard after all,
and be a classical scholar."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span></p>

<p>"I would never pay another," said Jack
seriously, "if I thought it would have that
effect."</p>

<p>When they returned to the wagon, they
found Mrs. Beadle still wiping away joyful
tears, while Hugh was apparently making
plans for the future. His voice rang out
loud and clear. "And we will dwell in a
corner of the house-top, and have a dinner of
herbs!" said the child. "They may have <i>all</i>
the stalled oxes themselves, mayn't they,
great-aunt? And you will clothe us in
scarlet and fine wool, won't you, great-aunt?"</p>

<p>"Bless your dear heart!" cried Mrs. Beadle.
"Is it red flannel you mean? Don't tell me
those heathen haven't put you into flannels!"
And she wept again.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE SECOND ACT.</div>


<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">Colonel Ferrers</span> was taking his afternoon
stroll in the garden. Dinner was over;
for at Roseholme, as at Braeside, country
hours were kept, with early dinner, and seven
o'clock tea, the pleasantest of all meals.</div>

<p>With a fragrant Manilla cigar between
his lips, and his good stick in his hand, the
Colonel paced up and down the well-kept gravel
paths, at peace with all mankind. The garden
was all ablaze with geranium and verbena,
heliotrope and larkspur. The pansies
spread a gold and purple mantle in their own
corner, while poppies were scattered all about
in well-planned confusion. All this was Giuseppe's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
work,&mdash;good, faithful Giuseppe, who
never rested, and never spoke, save to say
"Subito, Signor!" when his master called
him. He was at work now in a corner of
the garden, setting out chrysanthemums;
but no one would have known it, so noiseless
were his motions, so silent his coming and
going.</p>

<p>The Colonel, though pleasantly conscious
of the lovely pomp spread out for his delight,
was thinking of other things than flowers.
He was thinking how his nephew Jack had
improved in the last two months. Positively,
thought the Colonel, the boy was developing,
was coming out of the animal kingdom, and
becoming quite human. Partly due to the Indian
clubs, no doubt, and to his, the Colonel's,
wholesome discipline and instructions; but
largely, sir, largely to feminine influence.
Daily intercourse with women like Mrs. Grahame
and her daughter would civilise a gorilla,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
let alone a well-intentioned giraffe who
played the fiddle. He puffed meditatively at
his cigar, and dwelt on a pleasant picture that
his mind called up: Hildegarde as he had
seen her yesterday, sitting with a dozen little
girls about her, and telling them stories while
they sewed, under her careful supervision, at
patchwork and dolls' clothes. How sweet she
looked! how bright her face was, as she told
the merry tale of the "Midsummer Night's
Dream." "Harry Monmouth, sir! she was
telling 'em Shakespeare! And they were
drinking it in as if it had been Mother
Goose." The Colonel paused, and sighed
heavily. "If Hester had lived," he said, "if
my little Hester had lived&mdash;" and then he
drew a long whiff of the fragrant Manilla,
and walked on.</p>

<p>As he turned the corner by the great canna
plant, he came suddenly upon Mrs. Beadle,
who was apparently waiting to speak to him.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
The good housekeeper was in her state dress
of black silk, with embroidered apron and
lace mitts, and a truly wonderful cap; and
Colonel Ferrers, if he had been observant of
details, might have known that this portended
something of a serious nature. Being such
as he was, he merely raised his hat with his
grave courtesy, and said: "Good-afternoon,
Mrs. Beadle. Is it about the yellow pickles?
The same quantity as usual, ma'am, or perhaps
a few more jars, as I wish to send some
to Mrs. Grahame at Braeside."</p>

<p>Mrs. Beadle shivered a little. She had
made the yellow pickles at Roseholme for five
and twenty years; and now,&mdash;"No, sir," she
said faintly. "It is not the pickles." She
plucked at the fringe of her shawl, and
Colonel Ferrers waited, though with a kindling
eye. Women were admirable, but some
of their ways were hard to bear.</p>

<p>Finally Mrs. Beadle made a desperate effort,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
and said, "Do you think, sir, that you could
find some one to take my place?"</p>

<p>Colonel Ferrers fixed a look of keen inquiry
on her, and instantly felt her pulse.
"Rapid!" he said, "and fluttering; Elizabeth
Beadle, are you losing your mind?"</p>

<p>"I have found my little boy, sir," cried
Mrs. Beadle, bursting into tears. "My dear
niece Martha's own child, Colonel Ferrers.
He is in the hands of heathen reprobates, if I
do say it, and it is my duty to make a home
for him. I never thought to leave Roseholme
while work I could, but you see how it is, sir."</p>

<p>"I&mdash;see how it is?" cried the Colonel,
with a sudden explosion. Then controlling
himself by a great effort, he said with forced
calmness, "I will walk over to the end of the
garden, Elizabeth Beadle, and when I return
I shall expect a sensible and coherent&mdash;do
you understand?&mdash;<i>coherent</i> account of this
folderol. See how it is, indeed!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span></p>

<p>The Colonel strode off, muttering to himself,
and poor Mrs. Beadle wiped her eyes, and
smoothed down her apron with trembling
hands, and made up her mind that she would
not cry, if she should die for it.</p>

<p>When the grim-frowning Colonel returned,
she told her story with tolerable plainness,
and concluded by begging that her kind
friend and master would not be angry, but
would allow her to retire to a cottage, where
she could "see to" her niece's child, and bring
him up in a Christian way.</p>

<p>"Pooh! pooh! my good Beadle!" cried
the Colonel. "Stuff and nonsense, my good
soul! I am delighted that you have found
the child; delighted, I assure you. We will
get him away from those people, never fear
for that! and we will send him to school. A
good school, ma'am, is the place for the boy.
None of your Hardhacks, but a school where
he will be happy and well-treated. In vacation<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
time&mdash;hum! ha!&mdash;you might take a
little trip with him now and then, perhaps.
But as to disturbing your position here&mdash; Pooh!
pooh! stuff and nonsense! Don't let
me hear of it again!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Beadle trembled, but remained firm.
"No school, sir!" she said. "What the
child needs is a home, Colonel Ferrers; and
there's nobody but me to make one for him.
No, sir! never, if I gave my life to it, could
I thank you as should be for your kindness
since first I set foot in this dear house, as no
other place will ever be home to me! but go
I must, Colonel, and the sooner the better."</p>

<p>Then the Colonel exploded. His face
became purple; his eyes flashed fire, and,
leaning upon his stick, he poured out volley
upon volley of reproach, exhortation, argument.
Higher and higher rose his voice, till
the very leaves quivered upon the trees; till
the object of his wrath shook like an aspen,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
and even Giuseppe, in the north corner of
the garden, quailed, and murmured "Santa
Maria!" over his chrysanthemums.</p>

<p>How much more frightened, since theirs
was the blame of all the mischief, were two
guilty creatures who at this moment crouched,
concealed behind a great laurel-bush, listening
with all their ears!</p>

<p>Jack and Hildegarde exchanged terrified
glances. They had known that the Colonel
would be angry, but they had no idea of
anything like this. He was in a white heat
of rage, and was hurling polysyllabic wrath
at the devoted woman before him, who stood
speechless but unshaken, meekly receiving
the torrent of invective.</p>

<p>Suddenly, there was a movement among
the bushes; and the next moment a small
form emerged from the shade, and stood in
front of the furious old gentleman. "Is your
name Saul?" asked Hugh quietly.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span></p>

<p>The two conspirators had forgotten the
child. They had brought him with them,
with some faint idea of letting the Colonel
see him as if by accident, hoping that his
quaint grace might make a favourable impression;
but in the stress of the occasion they
had wholly forgotten his presence, and now&mdash;now
matters were taken out of their hands.
Hildegarde clutched her parasol tight; Jack
clasped his violin, and both listened and
looked with all their souls.</p>

<p>"Is your name Saul?" repeated the boy,
as the Colonel, astonishment choking for an
instant the torrent of his rage, paused speechless.
"Because if it is, the evil spirit from
God is upon you, and you should have some
one play with his hand."</p>

<p>"What&mdash;what is this?" gasped the
Colonel. "Who are you, boy?"</p>

<p>"I am my great-aunt's little nephew,"
said Hugh. "But no matter for me. You<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
must sit down when the evil spirit is upon
you. You might hurt some one. Why do
you look so at me, great-aunt? Why don't
you help Mr. Saul?"</p>

<p>"Come away, Hughie, love!" cried Mrs.
Beadle, in an agony of terror. "Come, dear,
and don't ever speak to the Colonel so again.
He's only a babe, sir, as doesn't know what he
is saying."</p>

<p>"Go away yourself!" roared the Colonel,
recovering the power of speech. "Depart,
do you hear? Remove yourself from my
presence, or&mdash;" he moved forward. Mrs.
Beadle turned and fled. "Now," he said,
turning to the child, "what do you mean,
child, by what you said just now? I&mdash;I
will sit down."</p>

<p>He sank heavily on a garden seat and
motioned the child before him. "What do
you mean, about Saul&mdash;eh?"</p>

<p>"But you know," said Hugh, opening wide<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
eyes of wonder,&mdash;"are you so old that you
forget?&mdash;how the evil spirit from God came
upon King Saul, and they sent for David,
and he played with his hand till the evil
spirit went away. Now you remember?" He
nodded confidently, and sat down beside the
Colonel, who, though still heaving and panting
from his recent outburst, made no motion
to repel him. "I said <i>Mr.</i> Saul," Hugh continued,
"because you are not a king, you see,
and I suppose just 'Saul' would not be polite
when a person is as old as you are. And
<i>what</i> do you think?" he cried joyously, as a
sudden thought struck him. "The ostrich
gentleman plays most <i>beautifully</i> with his
hand. His name isn't David, but that doesn't
matter. I am going to find him."</p>

<p>"Play, Jack," whispered Hildegarde. "Play,
<i>quick!</i> Something old and simple. Play
'Annie Laurie.'"</p>

<p>Obeying the girl's fleeting look, Jack laid<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
fiddle to bow, and the old love tune rose from
behind the laurel-bush and floated over the
garden, so sweet, so sweet, the very air seemed
to thrill with tenderness and gentle melody.</p>

<p>Colonel Ferrers sank back on the seat.
"Hester's song," he murmured. "Hester's
song. Is it Hester, or an angel?"</p>

<p>The notes rose, swelled into the pathetic
refrain,&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'>
"And for bonny Annie Laurie,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">I'd lay me down and die."</span><br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'>Then they sank away, and left the silence
still throbbing, as the hearts of the listeners
throbbed.</div>

<p>"<i>I</i> thought it was an angel," cried Hugh,
"when I first heard him, Mr. Saul. But it
isn't. It is the ostrich gentleman, and he
has to play up in the attic generally, because
his uncle is a poor person who doesn't know
how to like music. I am <i>so</i> sorry for his
uncle, aren't you?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes," said Colonel Ferrers gruffly. "Yes,
I am. Very sorry."</p>

<p>A pause followed. Then Hugh asked cautiously:
"How do you feel now, Mr. Saul?
Do you feel as if the evil spirit were going
away?"</p>

<p>"I've got him," said the Colonel, in whose
eyes the fire of anger was giving place to
something suspiciously like a twinkle. "I've
got him&mdash;bottled up. Now, youngster, who
told you all that?"</p>

<p>"All what?" asked Hugh, whose thoughts
were beginning to wander as he gazed around
the garden. "About the poor person who
doesn't know how to&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, no," said the Colonel hastily, "not
that. About Saul and David, and all that.
Who put you up to it? Hey?"</p>

<p>His keen eyes gazed intently into the clear
blue ones of the child. Hugh stared at him
a moment, then answered gently, with a note<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
of indulgence, as if he were speaking to a
much younger child: "It is in the Bible. It
is a pity that you do not know it. But perhaps
there are no pictures in your Bible.
There was a big one where I lived, all <i>full</i> of
pictures, so I learned to read that way. And
I always liked the Saul pictures," he added,
his eyes kindling, "because David was beautiful,
you know, and of a ruddy countenance;
and King Saul was all hunched up against
the tent-post, with his eyes glaring just as
yours were when you roared, only he was
uglier. You are not at all ugly now, but
then you looked as if you were going to burst.
If a person <i>should</i> burst&mdash;"</p>

<p>Colonel Ferrers rose, and paced up and
down the path, going a few steps each
way, and glancing frequently at the boy
from under his bushy eyebrows. Hugh fell
into a short reverie, and woke to say cheerfully:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<p>"This place fills me with heavenly joys.
Does it fill you?"</p>

<p>"Humph!" growled the Colonel. "If you
lived here, you would break all the flowers
off, I suppose, and pull 'em to pieces to see
how they grow; eh?"</p>

<p>Hugh contemplated him dreamily. "Is
that what you did when you were a little
boy?" he answered. "I love flowers. I
don't like to pick them, for it takes their life.
I don't care how they grow, as long as they
<i>do</i> grow."</p>

<p>"And you would take all the birds' eggs,"
continued the Colonel, "and throw stones at the
birds, and trample the flower-beds, and bring
mud into the house, and tie fire-crackers to the
cat's tail, and upset the ink. <i>I</i> know you!"</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 334px;"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249"></a>
<img src="images/gs06.png" width="334" height="500" alt="Hugh and Colonel Ferrers." title="" />
<span class="caption"><span class='smcap'>Hugh and Colonel Ferrers.</span></span>
</div>

<p>Hugh rose with dignity, and fixed his eyes
on the Colonel with grave disapproval. "You
do <i>not</i> know me!" he said. "And&mdash;and if
that is the kind of boy you were, it is no<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
wonder that the evil spirit comes upon you.
I shouldn't be a bit surprised if you did burst
some day. Good-by, Mr. Saul! I am going
away now."</p>

<p>"Hold on!" cried the Colonel peremptorily.
"I beg your pardon! Do you hear? Shake
hands!"</p>

<p>Hugh beamed forgiveness, and extended a
small brown paw, which was shaken with
right good will.</p>

<p>"That's right!" said Colonel Ferrers, with
gruff heartiness. "Now go into the house
and find your great-aunt, and tell her to give
you some jam. Do you like jam?" The
boy nodded with all the rapture of seven
years. "Give you some jam, and a picture-book,
and make up a bed in the little red
room. Can you remember all that?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Mr. Saul!" cried Hugh, dancing about
a little. "Nice Mr. Saul! Shall I bring you
some jam? What kind of jam shall I say?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span></p>

<p>"What kind do you like best?"</p>

<p>"Damson."</p>

<p>"Damson it is! Off with you now!"</p>

<p>When the boy was gone, the Colonel
walked up and down for a few moments,
frowning heavily, his hands holding his stick
behind him. Then he said quietly, "Jack!"</p>

<p>Jack came forward and stood before him,
looking half-proud, half-sheepish, with his
fiddle under his arm.</p>

<p>The Colonel contemplated him for a
moment in silence. Then, "Why in the
name of all that is cacophonous, didn't you
play me a tune at first, instead of an infernal
German exercise? Hey?"</p>

<p>Jack blushed and stammered. He had
played for his uncle once only, a fugue by
Hummel, of which his mind had happened to
be full; he felt that it had not been a judicious
choice.</p>

<p>"Can you play 'The Harp of Tara'?" demanded<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
the Colonel; and Jack played, with
exquisite feeling, the lovely old tune, the
Colonel listening with bent head, and marking
the time with his stick. "Harry Monmouth!"
he said, when it was over. "Because
a man doesn't like to attend the violent
ward of a cats' lunatic asylum, it doesn't follow
that he doesn't care for music. Music,
sir, is melody, that's what it is!"</p>

<p>Jack shuddered slightly, and did silent homage
to the shade of Wagner, but knew enough
to keep silence.</p>

<p>"And&mdash;and where did you pick up this
child?" his uncle continued. "I take it back
about his having been put up to what he did.
He is true blue, that child; I shouldn't
wonder if you were, too, in milksop fashion.
Hey?"</p>

<p>"Skim-milk is blue, you know, uncle,"
said Jack, smiling. "But I didn't discover
Hugh. Isn't he a wonderful child, sir?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
Hildegarde discovered him, of course. I believe
Hildegarde does everything, except what
her mother does. Come here, Hildegarde!
Come and tell Uncle Tom about your finding
Hugh."</p>

<p>But Hildegarde was gone.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER XIII.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>A PICNIC.</div>


<div class='unindent'>"<span class="smcap">My</span> dear Colonel, I congratulate you
most heartily! Indeed, I had little doubt of
your success, for this was a case in which
Reynard the Fox was sure to have the worst
of it. But I am very curious to know how
you managed it."</div>

<p>"Nothing could be simpler, my dear
madam. I went to the fellow's house
yesterday morning. 'Mr. Loftus, your little
nephew is at my house. Your aunt, Mrs.
Beadle, has taken charge of him, according to
his mother's wish, and I undertook to inform
you of the fact.' He turned all the colours
of the rainbow, began to bluster, and said<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
he was the boy's nearest relation, which is
very true. 'I want him to grow up a gentleman,'
said he. 'Precisely,' said I. 'He
shall have a chance to do so, Mr. Loftus.'
The fellow didn't like that; he looked black
and green, and spoke of the law and the
police. 'That reminds me,' I said, 'of a
story. About twenty-five years ago, or it
may be thirty, a sum of money was stolen
from my desk, in what I call my counting-room
in my own house. Am I taking up too
much of your valuable time, sir?' He choked
and tried to speak, but could only shake his
head. 'The thief was a mere lad,' I went on,
'and a clumsy one, for he dropped his pocketknife
in getting out of the window,&mdash;a knife
marked with his name. For reasons of my
own I did not arrest the lad, who left town
immediately after; but I have the knife,
Ephraim, in my possession.' I waited a
moment, and then said that I would send for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
the little boy's trunk; wished him good-day,
and came off, leaving him glowering after
me on the doorstep. You see, it was very
simple."</p>

<p>"I see," said Mrs. Grahame. "But is it
possible that Mr. Loftus&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Very possible, my dear Mrs. Grahame.
As I told him, I have the knife, with his
name in full. One hundred dollars he stole;
for Elizabeth Beadle's sake, of course I let it
go. Her peace of mind is worth more than
that, for if she's thoroughly upset, the dinners
she orders are a nightmare, positively a
nightmare. That is actually one reason why
I planned this picnic for to-day, because I
knew I should have something with cornstarch
in it if I dined at home. Why cornstarch
should connect itself with trouble in
the feminine mind, I do not know; but such
seems to be the case."</p>

<p>Mrs. Grahame laughed heartily at this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
theory; then, in a few earnest words, she told
Colonel Ferrers how deeply interested she
and her daughter were in this singular child,
and how happy they were in the sudden and
great change in his prospects.</p>

<p>"And I know you will love him," she
said. "You cannot help loving him, Colonel.
He is really a wonderful child."</p>

<p>"Humph!" said the Colonel thoughtfully.
Then after a pause, he continued: "I thought
I had lost the power of loving, Mrs. Grahame;
of loving anything but my flowers, that is,
any living creature; lost it forty years ago.
But somehow, of late, there has been a stirring
of the ground, a movement among the
old roots&mdash;yes! yes! there may be a little
life yet. That child of yours&mdash;you never
saw Hester Aytoun, Mrs. Grahame?"</p>

<p>"Never," said Mrs. Grahame softly. "She
died the year before I came here as a child."</p>

<p>"Precisely," said Colonel Ferrers. "She<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
was a&mdash;a very lovely person. Your daughter
is extremely like her, my dear madam."</p>

<p>"I fancied as much," said Mrs. Grahame,
"from the miniature I found in Uncle
Aytoun's collection."</p>

<p>"Ah! yes! the miniature. I remember,
there were two. I have the mate to it, Mrs.
Grahame. Yes! your daughter is very like
her. There was a strong attachment between
Hester and myself. Then came a mistake, a
misunderstanding, the puff of a feather, a
breath of wind; I went away. She was
taken suddenly ill, died of a quick consumption.
That was forty years ago, but it
changed my life, do you see? I have lived
alone. Robert Aytoun was a disappointed
man. Wealthy Bond,&mdash;you know the old
story,&mdash;Agatha an invalid, Barbara a rigorous
woman, strict Calvinist, and so forth.
We all grew old together. The neighbours call
me a recluse, a bear&mdash;I don't know what all;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
right enough they have been. But now&mdash;well,
first the lad, there, came&mdash;my brother's
son. Duty, you know, and all the rest of it;
father an unsuccessful genius, angel and
saint, with an asinine quality added. That
waked me up a little, but only made me
growl. But that child of yours, and your
own society, if you will allow me to say so&mdash;I
see things with different eyes, in short.
Why, I am actually becoming fond of my
milksop; a good lad, eh, Mrs. Grahame? an
honest, gentlemanly lad, I think?"</p>

<p>"Indeed, yes!" cried Mrs. Grahame heartily.
"A most dear and good lad, Colonel
Grahame! I cannot tell you how fond Hilda
and I are of him."</p>

<p>"That's right! that's right!" said the
Colonel, with great heartiness. "You have
done it all for him, between you. Holds up
his head now, walks like a Christian; and, positively,
I found him reading 'Henry Esmond,'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
the other day; reading it of his own accord,
you observe. Said his cousin Hilda said Esmond
was the finest gentleman she knew, and
wanted to know what he was like. When a
boy takes to 'Henry Esmond,' my dear madam,
he is headed in the right direction.
Asked me about Lord Herbert, too, at dinner
yesterday; really took an interest. Got that
from his cousin, too. How many girls know
anything about Lord Herbert? Tell me that,
will you?"</p>

<p>"Hildegarde has always been a hero-worshipper!"
said Mrs. Grahame, smiling, with
the warm feeling about the heart that a
mother feels when her child is praised. "You
make me very happy, Colonel, with all these
kind words about my dear daughter. What
she is to me, of course, I cannot tell. 'The
very eyes of me!' you remember Herrick's
dear old song. But I think my good black
auntie put it best, one day last week, when<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
Hildegarde had a bad headache, and was in
her room all day. 'Miss Hildy,' said auntie,
'she's de salt in de soup, she is. 'Tain't no
good without her.' But hark! here they
come back, with the water; and now, Colonel,
it is time for luncheon."</p>

<p>The speakers were sitting under a great
pine tree, one of a grove which crowned the
top of a green hill. Below them lay broad,
sunny meadows, here whitening into silver
with daisies, there waving with the young
grain. In a hollow at a little distance lay a
tiny lake, as if a giantess had dropped her
mirror down among the golden fields; further
off, dark stretches of woodland framed the
bright picture. It was a scene of perfect
beauty. Mrs. Grahame sat gazing over the
landscape, her heart filled with a great peace.
She listened to the young voices, which were
coming nearer and nearer. She was so glad
that she had made the effort to come. It had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
been an effort, even though Colonel Ferrers's
thoughtfulness had provided the most comfortable
of low phaetons, drawn by the slowest
and steadiest of cobs, which had brought her
with as little discomfort as might be to the
top of the hill. But how well worth the
fatigue it was to be here!</p>

<p>"And do you love me, Purple Maid?" It
was Hugh's clear treble that thrilled with
earnestness.</p>

<p>"I love you very much, dear lad! What
would you do if I did not, Hugh?"</p>

<p>"Oh! I should weep, and weep, and be a
<i>very</i> melancholy Jaques, indeed!"</p>

<p>"Melancholy Jaques!" muttered Colonel
Ferrers. "Where on earth did he get hold
of that? Extraordinary youngster!"</p>

<p>"He loves the Shakespeare stories," said
Mrs. Grahame. "Hilda tells them to him,
and reads bits here and there. Oh, I assure
you, Colonel Ferrers, Hugh is a revelation.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
There never was a child like him, I do
believe. But, hush! here he is!"</p>

<p>The boy's bright head appeared, as he came
up the hill, hand in hand with Hildegarde.
They were laden with ferns and flowers, while
Jack Ferrers, a few steps behind, carried a
pail of fresh water.</p>

<p>"Aha!" said the Colonel, rubbing his hands.
"Here we are, eh? What! you have robbed
the woods, Hildegarde? Scaramouche, how
goes it, hey?"</p>

<p>"It goes very well!" replied Hugh soberly,
but with sparkling eyes. "I am going to call
him 'Bonny Dundee,' because his name is
John Grahame, you see; and she says, perhaps
he <i>may</i> be a hero, too, some day; that
would be <i>so</i> nice!"</p>

<p>"Come, Hugh!" said Hildegarde, laughing
and blushing. "You must not tell our
secrets. Wait till he <i>is</i> a hero, and then he
shall have the hero's name."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span></p>

<p>"What!" cried the Colonel. "You young
Jacobite, are you instilling your pernicious
doctrines into this child's breast? Bonny
Dundee, indeed! Marmalade is all that I
want to know about Dundee. Bring the hamper,
Jack! here, under this tree! You are
quite comfortable here, Mrs. Grahame?"</p>

<p>"Extremely comfortable," said that lady.
"Now, you gentlemen may unpack the baskets,
while Hilda and I lay the cloth."</p>

<p>All hands went to work, and soon a most
tempting repast was set out under the great
pine tree. Colonel Ferrers's contribution was
a triumph of Mrs. Beadle's skill, and resembled
Tennyson's immortal</p>

<div class='poem'>
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">"Pasty costly made,</span><br />
Where quail and pigeon, lark and linnet lay,<br />
With golden yolks imbedded and injellied."<br />
</div>

<p>Indeed, the Colonel quoted these lines with
great satisfaction, as he set the great pie<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
down in the centre of the "damask napkin,
wrought with horse and hound."</p>

<p>"That is truly magnificent!" exclaimed
Mrs. Grahame. "And I can match it with
'the dusky loaf that smells of home,'" she
added, taking out of her basket a loaf of
graham bread and a pot of golden butter.</p>

<p>"Here is the smoked tongue," cried Hildegarde;
"here is raspberry jam, and almond
cake. Shall we starve, do you think, Colonel
Ferrers?"</p>

<p>"In case of extreme hunger, I have brought
a few peaches," said the Colonel; and he
piled the rosy, glowing, perfect globes in a
pyramid at a corner of the cloth.</p>

<p>"Cloth of gold shall be matched with cloth
of frieze," said Mrs. Grahame, and in the
opposite corner rose a pyramid of baked potatoes,
hot and hot, wafting such an inviting
smell through the air that the Colonel seized
the carving-knife at once.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span></p>

<p>"Are you ready?" he demanded. "Why&mdash;where
is Jack? Jack, you rascal! where
have you got to?"</p>

<p>"Here!" cried a voice among the bushes;
and Jack appeared, flushed with triumph,
carrying a smoking coffee-pot. "This is my
contribution," he said. "If it is only clear!
I think it is."</p>

<p>Hildegarde held out a cup, and he poured
out a clear amber stream, whose fragrance
made both potatoes and peaches retire from
the competition.</p>

<p>"You really made this?" Colonel Ferrers
asked. "You, sir?"</p>

<p>"I, sir," replied Jack. "Biddy taught me.
I&mdash;I have been practising on you for a couple
of days," he added, smiling. "You may remember
that your coffee was not quite clear
day before yesterday?"</p>

<p>"Clear!" exclaimed the Colonel, bending
his brows in mock anger. "I thought Lethe<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
and Acheron had been stirred into it. So
that is the kind of trick Elizabeth Beadle
plays on me, eh? Scaramouche!" addressing
Hugh, "you must look after this great-aunt
of yours, do you hear?"</p>

<p>"She made the pie," said Hugh diplomatically.</p>

<p>"She did! she did!" cried Hildegarde,
holding out her cup. "Let no one breathe a
word against her. Fill up, fill up the festal
cup! drop Friendship's sugar therein! two
lumps, my mother, if you love me!"</p>

<p>"Somebody should make a poem on this
pie," said Mrs. Grahame. "There never was
such a pie, I believe. Hilda, you seem in
poetic mood. Can you not improvise something?"</p>

<p>Hildegarde considered for a few minutes,
making meanwhile intimate acquaintance with
the theme of song; then throwing back her
head, she exclaimed with dramatic fervour:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'>
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">"I sing the pie!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3.5em;">The pie sing I!</span><br />
And yet I do not sing it; why?<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3.5em;">Because my mind</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3.5em;">Is more inclined</span><br />
To eat it than to glorify."<br />
</div>

<p>Anything will make people laugh at a picnic,
especially on a day when the whole
world is aglow with light and life and joy.
One jest followed another, and the walls of
the pie melted away to the sound of laughter,
as did those of Jericho at the sound of the
trumpet. Merlin, who had stayed behind to
watch a woodchuck, came up just in time to
consume the last fragments, which he did
with right good will. Then, when they had
eaten "a combination of Keats and sunset,"
as Mrs. Grahame called the peaches, the
Colonel asked permission to light his cigar;
and the soft fragrance of the Manilla mingled
with odours of pine and fir, while delicate<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
blue rings floated through the air, to the
delight of Hugh and Merlin.</p>

<p>"This is the nose dinner," said the child.
"It is almost better than the mouth dinner,
isn't it?"</p>

<p>"Humph!" said the Colonel, puffing meditatively.
"If you hadn't had the mouth dinner
first, young man, I think we should hear
from you shortly. Hest&mdash;a&mdash;Hildegarde,
will you give us a song?"</p>

<p>So Hildegarde sang one song and another,
the old songs that the Colonel loved: "Ben
Bolt," and "The Arethusa," and "A-hunting
we will go"; and then, for her own particular
pleasure and her mother's, she sang an old
ballad, to a strange, lovely old air that she
had found in an Elizabethan song-book.</p>

<div class='poem'>
"When shaws been sheene, and shraddes full faire,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">And leaves are large and long,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">It is merry walking in the fair forest,</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">To hear the small birds' song.</span><br />
<br />
"The woodwele sang, and would not cease,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Sitting upon the spray,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Soe loud, he wakened Robin Hood,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">In the greenwood where he lay."</span><br />
</div>

<p>It was the ballad of Robin Hood and Guy
of Gisborne; and when she sang the second
verse her mother's sweet alto chimed in; and
when she sang the third verse, Jack began to
whistle a soft, sweet accompaniment, the effect
of which was almost magical; and when
she sang the fourth verse,&mdash;wonder of wonders!
here was the Colonel humming a bass,
rather gruff, but in perfect tune.</p>

<p>When the ballad was over, there was
a chorus of surprise and congratulation.
"Colonel Ferrers! why didn't you tell us
you sang?"</p>

<p>"I say, Uncle Tom, you've been regularly
humbugging us. The idea of your turning
out a <i>basso profundo!</i>"</p>

<p>The Colonel looked pleased and conscious.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span></p>

<p>"Saul among the prophets, eh?" he said.
"This little rascal calls me Saul, you know,
Mrs. Grahame; caught me in a temper the
other day, and set Jack on me with his fiddle.
Ha! hum! Why, I used to sing a little, duets
and so forth, forty years ago. Always fond
of singing; fond of anything that has a tune
to it, though I can't abide your Dutch noises.
Where's your fiddle, Jack?"</p>

<p>Jack had not brought his fiddle; but he
whistled a Scotch reel that Colonel Ferrers
had not heard since before the flood, he said;
and then Hildegarde sang "Young Lochinvar,"
and so the pleasant moments went.</p>

<p>By and by, when the dishes were burned
(such a convenience are the paper dishes,
removing the only unpleasant feature of a
picnic, the washing of dishes or carrying
home of dirty ones), and everything neatly
packed away, Hugh challenged Hildegarde to
a race down the hill and across the long<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
meadow to the sunk wall beyond. Jack
claimed a place in the running, but the
Colonel insisted that he and Merlin should
give the others odds, as ostriches and quadrupeds
had an unfair advantage over ordinary
runners. Mrs. Grahame, after hunting in her
reticule, produced a prize, a rouleau of chocolate;
positions were taken, and Colonel Ferrers
gave the signal&mdash;one, two, three, and
away! Away went Hildegarde and the boy,
Jack holding Merlin, who was frantic with
impatience, and did not understand the theory
of handicaps. As the first pair reached the
bottom of the hill, the Colonel again gave
the signal, and the second two darted in
pursuit. "Away, away went Auster like an
arrow from the bow!"</p>

<p>Hildegarde was running beautifully, her
head thrown back, her arms close at her
sides; just behind her Hugh's bright head
bobbed up and down, as his little legs flew<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
like a windmill. But Jack Ferrers really
merited his name of the ostrich gentleman,
as with head poked forward, arms flapping,
and legs moving without apparent concert,
he hurled himself down the hill at a most
astonishing rate of speed. The Colonel and
Mrs. Grahame looked on with delight, when
suddenly both uttered an exclamation and
rose to their feet.</p>

<p>What was it?</p>

<p>From behind a clump of trees at a little
distance beyond Hildegarde, a large animal
suddenly appeared. It had apparently been
grazing, but now it stopped short, raised its
head, and gazed at the two figures which
came flying, all unconscious, towards it.</p>

<p>"John Bryan's bull!" cried Mrs. Grahame.
"Oh! Colonel Ferrers, the children! Hildegarde!"</p>

<p>"Don't be alarmed, dear madam!" said
the Colonel hastily, seizing his stick. "Remain<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
where you are, I beg of you. I will
have John Bryan hanged to-morrow! Meanwhile"&mdash;and
he hastened down the hill, as
rapidly as seventy years and a rheumatic
knee would permit.</p>

<p>But it was clear that whatever was to be
done must be done quickly. Hildegarde and
Hugh had seen the bull, and stopped. He
was well known as a dangerous animal, and
had once before escaped from his owner, a
neighbouring farmer. Mrs. Grahame, faint
with terror, saw little Hugh, with a sudden
movement, throw himself before Hildegarde,
who clasped her arms round him, and slowly
and quietly began to move backwards. The
bull uttered a bellow, and advanced, pawing
the ground; at first slowly, then more and
more rapidly as Hildegarde increased her pace,
till but a short distance intervened between
him and the two helpless children. Colonel
Ferrers was still a long way off. Oh! for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
help! help! The bull bellowed again, lowered
his huge head, and rushed forward. In
a moment he would be upon them. Suddenly&mdash;what
was this? A strange object appeared,
directly between the bull and his helpless
victims. What was it? The bull stopped
short, and glared at his new enemy. Two
long legs, like those of a man, but no body;
between the legs a face, looking at him with
fiery eyes. Such a thing the bull had never
seen. What was it? Men he knew, and
women, and children; knew and hated them,
for they were like his master, who kept him
shut up, and sometimes beat him. But this
thing! what was it? The strange figure
advanced steadily towards him; the bull
retreated&mdash;stopped&mdash;bellowed&mdash;retreated again,
shaking his head. He did not like this.
Suddenly the figure made a spring! turned
upside down. The long legs waved threateningly
in the air, and with an unearthly shriek<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
the monster came whirling forward in the
shape of a wheel. John Bryan's bull turned
and fled, as never bull fled before. Snorting
with terror, he went crashing through the
woods, that wild shriek still sounding in his
ears; and he never stopped till he reached his
own barnyard, where John Bryan promptly
beat him and tied him up.</p>

<p>Hildegarde, pale and trembling, held out
her hand as Jack, assuming his normal posture,
came forward. She tried to speak, but
found no voice, and could only press his hand
and look her gratitude.</p>

<p>Colonel Ferrers, much out of breath, came
up, and gave the lad's hand a shake that
might almost have loosened his arm in the
socket. "Well done, lad!" he cried. "You
are of the right stuff, after all, and
you'll hear no more 'milksop' from me.
Where did you learn that trick? Harry
Monmouth! the beast was frightened out of
his boots! Where did you learn it, boy?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span></p>

<p>"An Englishman showed it to me," said
Jack modestly. "It's nothing to do, but it
always scares them. How are you now, Hildegarde?
Sit down, and let me bring you
some water!"</p>

<p>But Hugh Allen clasped the long legs of
his deliverer, and cried joyously, "I knew
he was a David! he is a double David now,
isn't he, Beloved?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Hildegarde, smiling again, as
she turned to hasten up the hill to her
mother, "but <i>I</i> shall call him 'Bonny Dundee,'
for he has won the hero's name."</p>

<p>"It was the ostrich that won the day,
though," said Jack, looking at his legs.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>OVER THE JAM-POTS.</div>


<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">One</span> bright September morning Hildegarde
was sitting in the dining-room, covering jam-pots.
She had made the jam herself&mdash;peach
marmalade it was, the best in the world, all
golden-brown, like clear old amber&mdash;a day
or two before, and now it was firm enough to
cover. At her right hand was a pile of
covers, thick white paper cut neatly in rounds,
a saucer full of white of egg, another full of
brandy, an inkstand and pen. At her left was
an open book, and a large rosy apple. She
worked away busily with deft fingers, only
stopping now and then for a moment to nibble
her apple. First a small cover wet in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
brandy, fitting neatly inside the jar; then a
large cover brushed over with white of egg,
which, when dry, would make the paper stiff,
and at the same time fasten it securely
round the jar. And all the time she was
murmuring to herself, with an occasional
glance at the volume beside her,&mdash;</div>

<div class='poem'>
"'Sabrina fair, listen where thou art sitting,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Under the glassy, cool, translucent wave,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">In twisted braids of lilies knitting</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">The loose train of thy amber-dropping hair.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Listen for dear honour's sake,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Goddess of the silver lake,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">Listen and save!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Listen and appear to us,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">In name of great Oceanus.'"</span><br />
</div>

<p>Here she stopped to write on several jars
the paper on which was dry and hard; a bite
at her apple, and she continued,&mdash;</p>

<div class='center'>
"'By the earth-shaking Neptune's crook'&mdash;"<br />
</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span></p>

<p>"No," glancing at the book. "Why do I
always get that wrong?</p>

<div class='poem'>
"'By the earth-shaking Neptune's <i>mace</i>,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And Tethys' grave majestic pace;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">By hoary Nereus' wrinkled look,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And the Carpathian'&mdash;"</span><br />
</div>

<p>At this moment a shadow fell on the table,
as of some one passing by the window, and
the next moment Jack entered.</p>

<p>"What are you doing?" he asked, after the
morning greetings, sitting down and scowling
at the unoffending jam-pots. "Can't you
come out in the garden? It's no end of a
day, you know!"</p>

<p>"No end?" said Hildegarde. "Then I
shall have plenty of time, and I must finish
my jam-pots in any case, and my poetry."</p>

<p>"Poetry? are you making it?"</p>

<p>"Only learning it. I like to learn bits
when I am doing things of this sort.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span></p>

<div class='poem'>
"'By Leucothea's lovely hands,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And her son that rules the strands'&mdash;</span><br />
</div>

<p>"Wait just a moment, Jack. I think I
know it all now.</p>

<div class='poem'>
"'By Thetis' tinsel-slippered feet,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And the songs of Sirens sweet'&mdash;</span><br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'>Isn't that lovely, Jack?"</div>

<p>"Oh, yes," answered Jack absently. "What
<i>have</i> you been doing here, Hilda?" He was
studying the jars that were already marked,
and now read aloud,&mdash;</p>

<div class='center'>
"'William the Conqueror, his Jam, 1066.'<br />
<br />
"'Peach Marmalade.<br />
Put up by Hamlet, Prince of Denmark,<br />
For his own use.'<br />
</div>

<p>"What an extraordinary girl you are, Hildegarde!"</p>

<p>"Not at all extraordinary!" cried Hildegarde,
laughing and blushing. "Why<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
shouldn't I amuse myself? It hurts no one,
and it amuses me very much."</p>

<p>Jack laughed, and went on,&mdash;</p>

<div class='center'>
"'Marmaladus Crabappulis.<br />
C. J. C&aelig;sar fecit.<br />
Jam satis.'<br />
<br />
"'Crab-apple Jelly.<br />
Macbeth, Banquo &amp; Co., Limited.'<br />
<br />
"'Peach Marmalade.<br />
Made by<br />
John Grahame, Viscount Dundee. Gold Medal.'<br />
</div>

<p>"This ought to be mine."</p>

<p>"It shall be yours, greedy viscount. Get
a spoon and eat it at once, if you like."</p>

<p>"Thank you so much. I would rather
take it home, if I may. I say, what is that
brown stuff out on the porch, with mosquito
netting over it? Nothing very valuable, I
hope?"</p>

<p>"Oh, <i>Jack!</i>" cried Hildegarde, springing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
up, "my peach leather! What have you&mdash;did
you fall into it? Oh, and I thought you
were improving so much! I must go&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, don't go," said her cousin. "I&mdash;I
only knocked down one plate. And&mdash;Merlin
was with me, you know, and I don't believe
you would find any left. I am very sorry,
Hilda. Can I make some more for you?"</p>

<p>"I think not, my cousin. But no matter,
if it is only one plate, for there are a good
many, as you saw. Only, do be careful when
you go home, that's a good boy."</p>

<p>"What is it, anyhow?"</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;you cook it with brown sugar,
you know."</p>

<p>"Cook what? Leather?"</p>

<p>"Oh, dear! the masculine mind is <i>so</i>
obtuse&mdash;peaches, O sacred bird of Juno!"</p>

<p>"The eagle?"</p>

<p>"The goose. You really <i>must</i> study mythology,
Jack. You cook the peaches with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
brown sugar, and then you rub them through
a sieve,&mdash;it's a horrid piece of work!&mdash;and
then spread them on plates, just as you saw
them, and cover them to keep the flies off."</p>

<p>"And leave long ends trailing to trip up your
visitors."</p>

<p>"One doesn't expect giraffes to make
morning calls. So after a few days it hardens,
if it has the luck to be left alone, and
then you roll it up."</p>

<p>"Plates and all?"</p>

<p>"Of course! and sprinkle sugar over it, and
it is really delicious. I might have given you
that plate you knocked over, but now&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It was the smallest, I remember."</p>

<p>"And, Jack, I made it all myself. No one
else touched it. And all this marmalade, and
three dozen pots of currant jelly, and four
dozen of crab-apple."</p>

<p>"Sacred bird of Juno!" ejaculated her
cousin.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span></p>

<p>"Do you dare call <i>me</i> a goose, sir?"</p>

<p>"She drove peacocks, didn't she? I do
know a <i>little</i> mythology.</p>

<p>"But, Hildegarde, be serious now, will
you? I'm in a peck of trouble, as Biddy says.
I want consolation, or advice, or something."</p>

<p>"Sit down, and tell me," said Hildegarde,
full of interest at once.</p>

<p>Jack sat down and drummed on the table,
a thing that Hildegarde had never been
allowed to do.</p>

<p>"I got a letter from Daddy, yesterday," he
said, after a pause. "Herr Geigen is going to
Germany now, in a week, and Daddy says I
may go if Uncle Tom is willing."</p>

<p>"And he isn't willing?" Hilda said. "Oh!"</p>

<p>Jack got up and moved restlessly about the
room, laying waste the chairs as he went.
"Willing? He only roars, and says, 'Stuff
and nonsense!' which is no answer, you know,
Hilda. If he would just say 'No,' quietly,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
I&mdash;well, of course you can make up your
mind to stand a thing, and stand it. But he
won't listen to me for five minutes. If he
could realise&mdash;one can get as good an education
at Leipsic as at Harvard. But his idea
of Germany is a country inhabited by a crazy
emperor and a 'parcel of Dutch fiddlers,' and
by no one else. I shall have to give it up, I
suppose."</p>

<p>"Oh, no!" cried Hildegarde hopefully.
"Don't give it up yet. You know when
mamma spoke to him, he didn't absolutely
say 'No.' He said he would think about it.
Perhaps&mdash;she might ask him if he had
thought about it. Wait a day or two, at any
rate, Jack, before you write to your father.
Can you wait?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes! but it won't make any difference.
I suppose it's good for me. You say
all trouble is good in the end. Have you
ever had any trouble, I wonder, Hilda?"</p>

<p>"My father!" said Hildegarde, colouring.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span></p>

<p>"Forgive me!" cried her cousin. "I am
a brute! an idiotic brute! What shall I do?"
he said in desperation, seeing the tears in the
girl's clear eyes. "It would do no good if I
went and shot myself, or I would in a minute.
You will forgive me, Hilda?"</p>

<p>"My dear, there is nothing to forgive!"
said Hildegarde, smiling kindly at him.
"Nothing at all. I shouldn't have minded&mdash;but&mdash;it
is his birthday to-morrow," and
the tears overflowed this time, while Jack stood
looking at her in silent remorse, mentally
heaping the most frantic abuse upon himself.</p>

<p>The tears were soon dried, however, and
Hildegarde was her cheerful self again. "You
must go now," she said, "for I have all these
jam-pots to put away, and it is nearly dinner-time.
See! this jar of peach marmalade is
for Hugh, because he is fond of it. Of course
Mrs. Beadle can make it a great deal better,
but he will like this because his Purple Maid
made it. Isn't he a darling, Jack?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, he's a little brick, certainly. Uncle
Tom calls him the Ph[oe]nix, and is more delighted
with him every day. Now <i>there's</i> a
boy who ought to go to Harvard."</p>

<p>"He will," said Hildegarde, nodding
sagely. "Good-by, Jack dear!"</p>

<p>"It is very early. I don't see why I have
to go so soon! Can't I help you to put away
the jam-pots?"</p>

<p>"You can go home, my dear boy. Good-by!
I sha'nt forget&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, good-by!" and Jack flung off in half a
huff, as auntie would have said.</p>

<p>Hildegarde looked after him thoughtfully.
"How young he is!" she said to herself. "I
wonder if boys always are. And yet he is
two years older than I by the clock, if you
understand what I mean!" She addressed
the jam-pots, in grave confidence, and began
to put them away in their own particular cupboard.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>AT THE BROWN COTTAGE.</div>


<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">Hildegarde's</span> mind was still full of her
cousin and his future, as she sat that afternoon
in Mrs. Lankton's kitchen, with her
sewing-school around her. The brown cottage
with the green door had been found the
most central and convenient place for the little
class, and it was an object of absorbing
interest to Mrs. Lankton herself. She hovered
about Hildegarde and her scholars, predicting
disease and death for one and another,
with ghoulish joy.</div>

<p>"Your ma hadn't ought to let you come
out to-day, Marthy Skeat. You warn't never
rugged from the time you was a baby;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
teethin' like to have carried you off, and
'tain't too late now. There's wisdom teeth,
ye know. Well, it's none o' my business, but
I hope your ma's prepared. Good-mornin',
Miss Grahame! I'm tellin' Marthy Skeat she
ain't very likely to see long skirts, comin' out
in this damp air. You're peart, are ye? That's
right! Ah! they can look peart as ain't had
no troubles yet. I was jist like you oncet,
Miss Grahame. I've had a sight o' trouble!
no one don't know what I've ben through;
don't know nothin' about it. You've fleshed
up some since ye came here, ain't ye? Well,
they do flesh up that way sometimes, but
'tain't no good sign. There's measles about,
too, they say."</p>

<p>"How bright and pretty your plants are,
Mrs. Lankton!" said Hilda, trying to make
a diversion. "No, Jack!&mdash;I mean Jenny!
you will have to take that out again. See
those long stitches! They look as if they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
were all running after each other, don't
they? Take them out, dear, and make me
some nice, neat little stitches, stepping along
quietly, as you do when you have on those
new shoes you were telling me about. Lizzie,
I wonder what turns your thread so dark?
See how white my seam is! What do you
suppose is the matter with yours?"</p>

<p>Lizzie giggled and hung her head. "Forgot
to wash my hands!" she muttered.</p>

<p>"That was a pity!" said Hildegarde.
"It spoils the looks of it, you see. I am
sure Mrs. Lankton will let you wash your
hands in that bright tin basin. Vesta
Philbrook, where is your violin?"</p>

<p>"Ma'am?" said Vesta Philbrook, opening
her mouth as wide as her eyes.</p>

<p>"Your thimble I mean, of course!" said
Hildegarde, blushing violently, and giving
herself a mental shake. "Now go to work,
like a good girl. Mary, here is the patchwork<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
I promised you, already basted. See,
a pink square, a blue square, a white one, and
a yellow one. They are all pieces of my
dresses, the dresses I wore last summer; and
I thought you would like to have them for
your quilt."</p>

<p>"Oh, thank you!" cried the child, delighted.
"Oh, ain't them pretty?"</p>

<p>"Handsome!" said Mrs. Lankton, peering
over the child's shoulder. "Them is handsome.
Ah! I pieced a quilt once, with nine
hundred and ninety-nine pieces into it. Good
goods they was; I had good things then; real
handsome calico, just like them. Ah, I didn't
know what trouble was when I was your age,
children. Wait till you've had lumbago, an'
neurology, an' cricks in your necks so's't you
can't stand straight, not for weeks together
you can't, and your roof leakin', an' dreepin'
all over yer bed, an'&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Why, Mrs. Lankton!" exclaimed Hildegarde.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
"Surely the roof is not leaking again,
when it was all shingled this summer!"</p>

<p>"Not yet it ain't, dear!" sighed the widow.
"But I'm prepared for it, and I don't expect
nothin' else, after what I've been through.
I was fleshy myself, once, though no one
wouldn't think it to look at me."</p>

<p>"I wonder, Mrs. Lankton," began Hildegarde
gently.</p>

<p>"You may wonder, dear!" was the reply.
"Folks do wonder when they think what I've
bean through. Fleshy was no name for it.
There! I was fairly corpilent when I was
your age."</p>

<p>"Oh!" said Hildegarde, in some confusion.
"I meant&mdash;I am very thirsty, Mrs. Lankton,
and if you <i>could</i> give me a glass of your
delicious water&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Suttingly!" exclaimed the widow with
alacrity. "Suttingly, Miss Grahame! I'll
go right out and pump ye some. It <i>is</i> good<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
water," she admitted, with reluctant pride.
"I've been expectin' it would dry up, right
along, lately!" and she hastened out into the
yard.</p>

<p>"Now, children," said Hildegarde hastily,
"I will go on with the story I began last time.
'So Robert Bruce was crowned king of Scotland;
and no sooner was he king than'&mdash;"</p>

<p>By the time Mrs. Lankton returned with
the water, every child was listening spellbound
to the wonderful tale of Bruce at the
ford, and no one had an eye or an ear for
the doleful widow, save Hildegarde, whose
"Thank you!" and quick glance of gratitude
lightened for a moment the gloom of her
hostess's countenance.</p>

<p>So deep were teacher and pupils in Bruce
and patchwork that none of them heard the
sound of wheels, or the sudden cessation of
it outside the door, till Mrs. Lankton exclaimed
with tragic unction: "It is Colonel<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
Ferrers! driving hisself, and his hoss all of a
sweat. I hope he ain't the bearer of bad
news, but I should be prepared, if I was you,
Miss Grahame. Poor child! what would you
do if your ma was took?" Hildegarde hastened
to the door, but was instantly reassured
by the old gentleman's cheery smile.</p>

<p>"Why did you move?" he said. "I stopped
on purpose to have a look at you, with your
flock of doves around you. Hilda and the
doves, hey? you remember? 'Marble Faun!'
yes, yes! But since you have moved, shall I
drive you home, Miss Industry?"</p>

<p>Hildegarde glanced at the clock. "Our
time is over," she said to the children. "Yes,
Colonel Ferrers, thank you! I should enjoy
the drive very much indeed. Can you wait
perhaps five minutes?"</p>

<p>The Colonel could and would; and Hildegarde
returned to see that all work was neatly
folded and put away.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span></p>

<p>"And, Annie, here is the receipt I promised
you. Be sure to mix the meal thoroughly, and
have a good hot oven, and you will find them
very nice indeed, and your mother will be so
pleased at your making them yourself!"</p>

<p>"Vesta, did you try the honey candy?"</p>

<p>"Yes, 'm! 'twas dretful good. My little
brother, he like t'ha' died, he eat so much."</p>

<p>"Dear me!" exclaimed Hilda, rather alarmed
at this result of her neat little plan of teaching
the children something about cookery,
without their finding out that they were
being taught.</p>

<p>"But you must see to it, Vesta, that he
doesn't eat too much. That is one of the
things an elder sister is for, you know.</p>

<p>"Now, whose turn is it to sweep up the
threads and scraps? Yours, Euleta? Well,
see how careful you can be! not a thread
must be left on Mrs. Lankton's clean floor,
you know."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span></p>
<div class="figleft" style="width: 320px;"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301"></a>
<img src="images/gs08.png" width="320" height="500" alt="&quot;He gave me a lunge in quart.&quot;" title="" />
<span class="caption"><span class='smcap'>&quot;He gave me a lunge in quart.&quot;</span></span>
</div>
<p>Soon all was in order, workbags put away,
hats and bonnets tied on; and Hildegarde
came out with her doves about her, all looking
as if they had had a thoroughly good
time. With many affectionate farewells to
"Teacher," the children scattered in different
directions, and Colonel Ferrers chirruped to
the brown cob, which trotted briskly away
over the smooth road. The Colonel was
deeply interested in the sewing-school. Hester
Aytoun had had one for the village children,
and there had been none from her death
until now. He asked many questions, which
Hildegarde answered with right good will.
They were dear children, she said. She was
getting to know them very well, for she tried
to see them in their homes once a fortnight,
and found they liked to have her come, and
looked forward to it. Some of them were
very bright; not all, of course, but they all
<i>tried</i>, and that was the great thing. Yes,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
she told them all the stories they wanted,
and they wanted a great many.</p>



<p>"Speaking of stories," said the Colonel, "I
find I have work laid out for the rest of <i>my</i>
life."</p>

<p>"Hugh?" said Hildegarde, smiling.</p>

<p>"Most astonishing child I ever saw in my
life!" the Colonel cried. "Most amazing
child! to see how he flings himself on books
is a wonder. I don't let him keep at 'em
long, you understand. A brain like that
needs play, sir, play! I've bought him a
little foil, and&mdash;Harry Monmouth! he gave
me a lunge in quart that almost broke my
guard, last night. But stories! 'More about
kings, please, Sire!'&mdash;he's got a notion of calling
me Sire&mdash;ho! ho! can't get Saul out of
his head, d'ye see? I feel like Charlemagne,
or Barbarossa, or some of 'em. 'More about
kings when they were in battle.' He's learned
'Agincourt' by heart, just from my reading<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
it to him. 'Fair stood the wind for France,'
hey? Finest ballad in the English language.
Says you read it to him, too. And if I
am busy he goes to Elizabeth Beadle and
frightens her out of her wits with sentences
out of the Lamentations of Jeremiah. Now
this boy&mdash;mark me, Hildegarde!&mdash;will turn
out something very uncommon, if he has the
right training. That scoundrelly knave,
Ephraim Loftus, wanted to make a gentleman
of him! Ho! Ephraim doesn't know
how a gentleman's shoes look, unless he has
been made acquainted with the soles of them.
I kicked him myself once, I remember, for
beating a horse unmercifully. This boy will
be a great scholar, mark my words! And
whatever assistance I can give him shall be
cheerfully given. Why, the lad has genius!
positive genius!"</p>

<p>"Oh!" said Hildegarde, her heart beating
fast. "Then you think, Colonel Ferrers, that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
a&mdash;a person should be educated for what
seems to be his natural bent. Do you think
that?"</p>

<p>"Harry Monmouth! of course I do! Look
at me! D'ye think I was fitted for a mercantile
life, for example? Never got algebra
through my head, and hate figures. The
army was what I was born for! Born for it,
sir! Shouldered my pap-spoon in the cradle,
and presented arms whenever I was taken up.
Ho! ho! ho!"</p>

<p>Hildegarde began to tremble, but her courage
did not fail. "And&mdash;and Jack, dear
Colonel Ferrers," she said softly. "He was
born for music, was he not?"</p>

<p>The Colonel turned square round, and
gazed at her from under brows that met over
his hooked nose. "What then?" he said
slowly, after a pause. "If my nephew was
born for a fiddler, what then, Miss Hildegarde
Grahame? Is it any reason why he should<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
not be trained for something better? I like
the boy's playing very well, very well indeed,
when he keeps clear of Dutch discords. But
you would not compare playing the fiddle
with the glorious Art of War, I imagine?"</p>

<p>"Not for an instant!" cried Hildegarde,
flushing deeply under the Colonel's half-stern,
half-quizzical gaze. "Compare music, lovely
music, that cheers and comforts and delights
all the world, with fierce, cruel, dreadful war?
Look at Jack, with his mind full of beautiful
harmonies and&mdash;and 'airs from heaven'&mdash;they
really are! making us laugh or cry,
or dance or exult, just by the motion of his
hand. Look at him, and then imagine him
in a red coat, with a gun in his hand&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Red is the British colour," said the Colonel.</p>

<p>"Well, a blue coat, then. What difference
does it make?&mdash;a gun in his hand, shooting
people who never did him any harm, whose<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
faces he had never even seen. Oh, Colonel
Ferrers, I would not have believed it of you!"</p>

<p>"And who asked you to believe it of me,
pray?" asked the Colonel, as he drove up to
the door of Braeside. "To tell the truth,
young lady, war is very much more in your
line than in my nephew's. Harry Monmouth!
Bellona in person, I verily believe. My compliments
to your mother, and say I shall call
her Madam Alth&aelig;a in future, for she has
brought forth a firebrand."</p>

<p>Instantly Hildegarde's ruffled plumes
drooped, smoothed themselves down; instead
of the flashing gaze of the eagle, a dove-like
look now met the quizzical gaze of the old
gentleman. "Dear Colonel Ferrers!" this
hypocritical girl murmured, as, standing on
the verandah steps, she laid her hand gently
on his arm. "Thank you so <i>very</i> much for
driving me home. You are always so kind&mdash;to
me! And&mdash;and&mdash;I want to ask one<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
question. Can you tell me the first lines of
Dryden's 'Song for St. Cecilia's Day'?"</p>

<p>"Of course!" said the simple Colonel.</p>

<div class='poem'>
"'From harmony, from heavenly harmony,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">This universal frame began.'</span><br />
</div>

<p>Why do you&mdash;oh! you youthful Circe!
you infant Medea, you&mdash;" he shook his
whip threateningly.</p>

<p>"Good-by, dear Colonel Ferrers!" cried
Hildegarde. "I am so glad you remembered
the lines. Aren't they beautiful? Good-by!"</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER XVI.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>GOOD-BY!</div>


<div class='unindent'>"<span class="smcap">I have</span> come to say good-by!" cried
Jack Ferrers, rushing up the steps, as Hildegarde
was sitting on the piazza, with Hugh
curled up at her feet. "Uncle Tom will
come for me with the wagon. Oh, Hilda, it
doesn't seem possible, does it? It is too good
to be true! and it is all your doing, every
bit. I sha'n't forget it. I say! I wish you
were coming too!"</div>

<p>"Oh, no, you don't!" said Hildegarde,
speaking lightly, though her cheeks were
flushed and her eyes bright with real feeling.
"You would send me back by express, labelled
'troublesome baggage.'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span></p>

<p>"Dear old Jack! You know how glad I
am, without my saying it. But, oh! how we
shall miss you! Your uncle&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh! Hugh will take care of Uncle Tom,
won't you, Hugh? Hugh suits him down to
the ground&mdash;I beg pardon, I mean through
and through, and they will have fine times
together."</p>

<p>"I will try!" said the child. "But we
shall be like a pelican in the wilderness, I am
afraid."</p>

<p>"You go straight home now?" Hildegarde
asked.</p>

<p>"Straight home! five days with Daddy&mdash;bless
him! and then he goes to New York
with me, and sees me off. Oh! see here!"
he began fumbling in his pockets. "I have
a keepsake for you. I&mdash;of course you know
I haven't any money, Hilda, or I would have
bought you something; but Uncle Tom gave
it to me on purpose to give to you; so it's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
partly from him, too. Here it is! It belonged
to our great-grandmother, he says."</p>

<p>Such a lovely ring! A star of yellow diamonds
set on a hoop of gold. Hildegarde
flushed with delight. "Oh, Jack! how kind
of him! how dear of you! Oh! what an
exquisite thing! I shall wear it always."</p>

<p>"And&mdash;I say! how well it looks on your
hand! I never noticed before what pretty
hands you have, Hilda. You are the prettiest
girl I ever saw, altogether."</p>

<p>"And Rose?" asked Hildegarde, smiling.</p>

<p>Jack blushed furiously. He had fallen
deeply in love with Rose's photograph, and
had been in the habit of gazing at it for ten
or fifteen minutes every day for the past fortnight,
ever since it arrived. "That's different!"
he said. "She is an angel, if the picture
is like her."</p>

<p>"It isn't half lovely enough!" cried loyal
Hildegarde. "Not half! You don't see the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
blue of her eyes, or her complexion, just like
'a warm white rose.' Oh! you <i>would</i> love
her, Jack!"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I rather think I do!" Jack confessed.
"You might let me have the photograph,
Hildegarde."</p>

<p>But this Hildegarde wholly refused to do.
"I have something much more useful for
you!" she said; and, running into the house,
she brought out a handkerchief-case of linen,
daintily embroidered, containing a dozen fine
hemstitched handkerchiefs. "I hemstitched
them myself," she said; "the peacock still
spreads its tail, you observe. And&mdash;see!
on one side of the case are forget-me-nots&mdash;that
is my flower, you know; and on the
other are roses. I take credit for putting the
roses on top."</p>

<p>"Dear Hilda!" cried her cousin, giving her
hand a hearty shake. "What a good fel&mdash;what
a jolly girl you are! You ought," he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
added shyly, "to marry the best man in the
world, and I hope you will."</p>

<p>"I mean to," said Hildegarde, laughing,
with a happy light in her eyes.</p>

<p>Hildegarde had never seen her "fairy
prince, with joyful eyes, and lighter-footed
than the fox"; but she knew he would come
in good time. She knew, too, very much
what he was like,&mdash;a combination of Amyas
Leigh, Sir Richard Grenville, Dundee, and
Montrose, with a dash of the Cid, and a
strong flavour of Bayard, the constancy of
William the Silent, the kindness of Scott,
and the eyes of Edwin Booth. Some day he
would come, and find his maiden waiting for
him. Meantime, it was so very delightful
to have Jack fall in love with Rose. If&mdash;she
thought, and on that "if" rose many a
Spanish castle, fair and lofty, with glittering
pinnacle and turret. But she had not the
heart to tell Jack of the joyful news she had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
just received, dared not tell him of the letter
in her pocket which said that this dearest
Rose was coming soon, perhaps this very
week, to make her a long, long visit. If she
could only have come earlier!</p>

<p>But now Jack was taking his violin out of
his box. "Where is your mother?" he said.
"This is my own, this present for you both.
It is 'Farewell to Braeside!'"</p>

<p>Hildegarde flew to call her mother, and
met her just coming downstairs. "Jack has
composed a farewell for us," she cried. "All
for us, mamma! Come!"</p>

<p>Farewell! the words seemed to breathe
through the lovely melody, as the lad played
softly, sweetly, a touch of sadness underlying
the whole. "Farewell! farewell! parting is
pain, is pain, but Love heals the wound with a
touch. Love flies over land and sea, bringing
peace, peace, and good tidings and joy." Then
the theme changed, and a strain of triumph,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
of exultation, made the air thrill with happiness,
with proud delight. The girl and her
mother exchanged glances. "This is his
work, his life!" said their eyes. And the
song soared high and higher, till one fine,
exquisite note melted like a skylark into the
blue; then sinking gently, gently, it flowed
again into the notes of the farewell,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Parting is pain, is pain, but Love is immortal."</p>

<p>Both women were in tears when the song
died away, and Jack's own eyes were suspiciously
bright.</p>

<p>"My dear boy," said Mrs. Grahame, wiping
her eyes, "I do believe you are going to a
life of joy and of well-earned triumph. I
do heartily believe it."</p>

<p>"It is all Hilda's doings," said Jack, "and
yours. All Hilda's and yours, Aunt Mildred.
I shall not forget."</p>

<p>Here Hugh, who had been listening spellbound,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
asked suddenly, "What was the name
of the boat which the gentleman who begins
with O made to go swiftly over the sea when
he played with his hand?"</p>

<p>"The <i>Argo</i>, dear," said Hildegarde.</p>

<p>"It is that boat <i>he</i> should go in," nodding
to Jack. "It would leap like an unicorn,
wouldn't it, if he played those beautiful
things which he just played?"</p>

<p>And now Colonel Ferrers drove up to the
door, with the brown cob and the yellow
wagon. The last words were said; the
precious violin was carefully stowed under
the seat. Jack kissed Mrs. Grahame warmly,
and exchanged with Hildegarde a long, silent
pressure of the hand, in which there was a
whole world of kindness and affection and
comradeship. Boys and girls can be such
<i>good</i> friends, if they only know how!</p>

<p>"Boot and saddle!" cried the Colonel.</p>

<p>"Good-by!" cried the lad, springing into<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
the wagon. "Good-by! Don't forget the
ostrich gentleman!"</p>

<p>"Good-by, dear Jack!"</p>

<p>"God bless you, my dear lad! Good-by!"
and the wheels went crashing over the gravel.</p>

<p>At the end of the driveway the Colonel
checked his horse for a moment before turning
into the main road. "Look back, boy,"
he said.</p>

<p>Jack looked, and saw Hildegarde and her
mother standing on the verandah with arms
entwined, gazing after them with loving looks.
The girl's white-clad figure and shining locks
were set in a frame of hanging vines and
creepers; her face was bright with love and
cheer. The slender mother, in her black
dress, seemed to droop and lean towards her;
on the other side the child clasped her hand
